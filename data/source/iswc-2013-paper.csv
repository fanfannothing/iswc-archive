We propose an approach, called Topical Relational Model, as a principled approach for automatically learning topics from both textual and structure information.

In this article, we propose a semi-automatic schemata construction approach addressing this problem: First, the frequency of axiom patterns in existing knowledge bases is discovered. Afterwards, those patterns are converted to SPARQL based pattern detection algorithms, which allow to enrich knowledge base schemata. We argue that we present the ﬁrst scalable knowledge base enrichment approach based on real schema usage patterns.

Here we consider three logically sound notions of modules: MEX modules, only applicable to inexpressive ontologies; modules based on semantic locality, a sound approximation of the ﬁrst; and modules based on syntactic locality, a sound approximation of the second (and thus the ﬁrst), widely used since these modules can be extracted from OWL DL ontologies in time polynomial in the size of the ontology. In this paper we investigate the quality of both approximations over a large corpus of ontologies, using our own implementation of semantic locality, which is the ﬁrst to our knowledge. In particular, we show with statistical signiﬁcance that, in most cases, there is no diﬀerence between the two module notions based on locality; where they diﬀer, the additional axioms can either be easily ruled out or their number is relatively small. We classify the axioms that explain the rare diﬀerences into four kinds of “culprits” and discuss which of those can be avoided by extending the deﬁnition of syntactic locality. Finally, we show that diﬀerences between MEX and locality-based modules occur for a minority of ontologies from our corpus and largely aﬀect (approximations of ) expressive ontologies – this conclusion relies on a much larger and more diverse sample than existing comparisons between MEX and syntactic locality-based modules.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2013,"Research Track Paper",http://www.iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/accepted-papers,EOL

Of particular interest is entity search, where the units of retrieval are structured entities instead of textual documents. These entities reside in diﬀerent sources, which may provide only limited information about their content and are therefore called “uncooperative”. Further, these sources capture complementary but also redundant information about entities. In this environment of uncooperative data sources, we study the problem of federated entity search, where redundant information about entities is reduced on-the-ﬂy through entity consolidation performed at query time. We propose a novel method for entity consolidation that is based on using language models and completely unsupervised, hence more suitable for this on-the-ﬂy uncooperative setting than state-of-the-art methods that require training data. Further, we apply the same language model technique to deal with the federated search problem of ranking results returned from diﬀerent sources. Particular novel are the mechanisms we propose to incorporate consolidation results into this ranking. We perform experiments using real Web queries and data sources.

We designed this new version of the WebProtégé user interface empirically, by analysing the use of OWL constructs in a large corpus of publicly available ontologies.

Yet, so far, little attention has been paid to the characteristics of geo-spatial data within the context of link discovery. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting Orchid, a reduction-ratio-optimal link discovery approach designed especially for geo-spatial data. Orchid relies on a combination of the Hausdorﬀ and orthodromic metrics to compute the distance between geo-spatial objects. We ﬁrst present two novel approaches for the eﬃcient computation of Hausdorﬀ distances. Then, we present the space tiling approach implemented by Orchid and prove that it is optimal with respect to the reduction ratio that it can achieve. The evaluation of our approaches is carried out on three real datasets of diﬀerent size and complexity. Our results suggest that our approaches to the computation of Hausdorﬀ distances require two orders of magnitude less orthodromic distances computations to compare geographical data. Moreover, they require two orders of magnitude less time than a naive approach to achieve this goal.

How does she know which ontology is the most relevant to her search? Our research group hosts BioPortal, a public repository of more than 330 ontologies in the biomedical domain. When a term that a user searches for is available in multiple ontologies, how do we rank the results and how do we measure how well our ranking works? In this paper, we develop an evaluation framework that enables developers to compare and analyze the performance of diﬀerent ontology-ranking methods. Our framework is based on processing search logs and determining how often users select the top link that the search engine oﬀers. We evaluate our framework by analyzing the data on BioPortal searches. We explore several diﬀerent ranking algorithms and measure the eﬀectiveness of each ranking by measuring how often users click on the highest ranked ontology. We collected log data from more than 4,800 BioPortal searches. Our results show that regardless of the ranking, in more than half the searches, users select the ﬁrst link. Thus, it is even more critical to ensure that the ranking is appropriate if we want to have satisﬁed users. Our further analysis demonstrates that ranking ontologies based on page view data signiﬁcantly improves the user experience, with an approximately 26% increase in the number of users who select the highest ranked ontology for the search.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2013,"Research Track Paper",http://www.iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/accepted-papers,EOL

For this reason, Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs) increasingly contain information about the searched entities such as pictures, short summaries, related entities, and factual information. A key facet that is often displayed on the SERPs and that is instrumental for many applications is the entity type. However, an entity is usually not associated to a single generic type in the background knowledge bases but rather to a set of more speciﬁc types, which may be relevant or not given the document context. For example, one can ﬁnd on the Linked Open Data cloud the fact that Tom Hanks is a person, an actor, and a person from Concord, California. All those types are correct but some may be too general to be interesting (e.g., person), while other may be interesting but already known to the user (e.g., actor), or may be irrelevant given the current browsing context (e.g., person from Concord, California). In this paper, we deﬁne the new task of ranking entity types given an entity and its context. We propose and evaluate new methods to ﬁnd the most relevant entity type based on collection statistics and on the graph structure interconnecting entities and types. An extensive experimental evaluation over several document collections at diﬀerent levels of granularity (e.g., sentences, paragraphs, etc.) and diﬀerent type hierarchies (including DBPedia, Freebase, and schema.org) shows that hierarchy-based approaches provide more accurate results when picking entity types to be displayed to the end-user while still being highly scalable.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2013,"Research Track Paper",http://www.iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/accepted-papers,EOL

In this context, materializing every possible implicit derivation from a given input can be computationally expensive, especially when considering large data volumes. Most of the solutions that address this problem rely on the assumption that the information is static, i.e., that it does not change, or changes very infrequently. However, the Web is extremely dynamic: online newspapers, blogs, social networks, etc., are frequently changed so that outdated information is removed and replaced with fresh data. This demands for a materialization that is not only scalable, but also reactive to changes. In this paper, we consider the problem of incremental materialization, that is, how to update the materialized derivations when new data is added or removed. To this purpose, we consider the ρdf RDFS fragment [12], and present a parallel system that implements a number of algorithms to quickly recalculate the derivation. In case new data is added, our system uses a parallel version of the well-known semi-naive evaluation of Datalog. In case of removals, we have implemented two algorithms, one based on previous theoretical work, and another one that is more eﬃcient since it does not require a complete scan of the input. We have evaluated the performance using a prototype system called DynamiTE , which organizes the knowledge bases with a number of indices to facilitate the query process and exploits parallelism to improve the performance. The results show that our methods are indeed capable to recalculate the derivation in a short time, opening the door to reasoning on much more dynamic data than is currently possible.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2013,"Research Track Paper",http://www.iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/accepted-papers,EOL

However, quite a few hyperlinks have not been anotated by editors in infoboxes, which causes lots of relations between entities being missing in Wikipedia. In this paper, we propose an approach for automatically discovering the missing entity links in Wikipedia’s infoboxes, so that the missing semantic relations between entities can be established. Our approach ﬁrst identiﬁes entity mentions in the given infoboxes, and then computes several features to estimate the possibilities that a given attribute value might link to a candidate entity. A learning model is used to obtain the weights of diﬀerent features, and predict the destination entity for each attribute value. We evaluated our approach on the English Wikipedia data, the experimental results show that our approach can eﬀectively ﬁnd the missing relations between entities, and it signiﬁcantly outperforms the baseline methods in terms of both precision and recall.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2013,"Research Track Paper",http://www.iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/accepted-papers,EOL

The contextual tag cloud system is a novel application that helps users explore a large scale RDF dataset: the tags are ontological terms (classes and properties), the context is a set of tags that deﬁnes a subset of instances, and the font sizes reﬂect the number of instances that use each tag. It visualizes the patterns of instances speciﬁed by the context a user constructs. Given a request with a speciﬁc context, the system needs to quickly ﬁnd what other tags the instances in the context use, and how many instances in the context use each tag. The key question we answer in this paper is how to scale to Linked Data; in particular we use a dataset with 1.4 billion triples and over 380,000 tags. This is complicated by the fact that the calculation should, when directed by the user, consider the entailment of taxonomic and/or domain/range axioms in the ontology. We combine a scalable preprocessing approach with a specially-constructed inverted index and use three approaches to prune unnecessary counts for faster intersection computations. We compare our system with a state-of-the-art triple store, examine how pruning rules interact with inference and analyze our design choices.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2013,"Research Track Paper",http://www.iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/accepted-papers,EOL

A common problem is the imprecision in the use of vocabularies: annotators can misunderstand the semantics of a class or property or may not be able to ﬁnd the right objects to annotate with. This decreases the quality of data and may eventually hamper its usability over large scale. This paper describes Statistical Knowledge Patterns (SKP) as a means to address this issue. SKPs encapsulate key information about ontology classes, including synonymous properties in (and across) datasets, and are automatically generated based on statistical data analysis. SKPs can be eﬀectively used to automatically normalise data, and hence increase recall in querying. Both pattern extraction and pattern usage are completely automated. The main beneﬁts of SKPs are that: (1) their structure allows for both accurate query expansion and restriction; (2) they are context dependent, hence they describe the usage and meaning of properties in the context of a particular class; and (3) they can be generated oﬄine, hence the equivalence among relations can be used eﬃciently at run time.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2013,"Research Track Paper",http://www.iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/accepted-papers,EOL

Results indicate that real-time processing of city information streams based on semantic technologies is indeed not only possible, but also efﬁcient, scalable and low-latency.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2013,"Semantic Web In Use Track Paper",http://www.iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/accepted-papers,EOL

Semantic web technologies should be ideal for exploring the complex networks of genes, proteins and metabolites that interact, but much of this data is not natively available to the semantic web. Data is typically collected and stored with free-text annotations in spreadsheets, many of which do not conform to existing metadata standards and are often not publica lly released. Along with initiatives to promote more data sharing, one of the main challenges is therefore to semantically annotate and extract this data so that it is available to the research community. Data annotation and curation are expensive and undervalued tasks that have enormous benefits to the discipline as a whole, but fewer benefits to the individual data producers. By embedding semantic annotation into spreadsheets, however, and automat ically extracting this data into RDF at the time of repository submission, the process of producing standards-compliant data, that is available for semantic web querying, can be achieved without adding additional overheads to laboratory data management. This paper describes these strategies in the context of semantic data management in the SEEK. The SEEK is a web-based resource for sharing and exchanging Systems Biology data and models that is underpinned by the JERM ontology (Just Enough Results Model), which describes the relationships between data, models, protocols and experiments.

The study of query demographics on DBPedia logs shows that the vast ma jority of queries are acyclic and a signicant part of them uses UNION or pro jection.

It is frequently unclear, however, to what degree extralogical ontology errors negatively affect the application that the ontology underpins. For example, “Shoe SubClassOf Foot” may be correct logically, but not in a human interpretation. Indeed, such errors, not caught by reasoning, are likely to be domain-speciﬁc, and thus identifying salient ontology errors requires consideration of the domain. There are both automated and manual methods that provide ontology quality assurance. Nevertheless, these methods do not readily scale as ontology size increases, and do not necessarily identify the most salient extralogical errors. Recently, crowdsourcing has enabled solutions to complex problems that computers alone cannot solve. For instance, human workers can quickly and more accurately identify objects in images at scale. Crowdsourcing presents an opportunity to develop methods for ontology quality assurance that overcome the current limitations of scalability and applicability. In this work, I aim (1) to determine the effect of extralogical ontology errors in an example domain, (2) to develop a scalable framework for crowdsourcing ontology veriﬁcation that overcomes current ontology Q/A method limitations, and (3) to apply this framework to ontologies in use.

The focus of our study is on improving diabetes patient selection for clinical trials or medical research. The biggest impediment to automating such clinical tasks is the essential requirement of bridging the semantic gaps between existing patient data from electronic health records, such as reasons for visit, chronic conditions and diagnoses from practice notes, pathology tests and prescriptions stored in general practice information systems, and the ways which researchers or general practitioners interpret those records. Our current comprehension is that automation of identifying diabetes patients for clinical or research purposes can be specified systematically as a solution supported by semantic retrieval. We detail the challenges to build a realistic case study, which consists of solving issues related to conceptualization of data and domain context, integration of different datasets, ontology creation based on SNOMED CT-AU® standard, mapping between existing data and ontology, and dilemma of data fitness for research use.

At over 31 billion triples in 2011, querying this globally distributed data space poses several scalability challenges. One critical aspect when processing distributed SPARQL queries is given by the number and type of distributed joins needed. Traditionally, query optimizers alleviate this issue by attempting to find an optimal query plan assuming a given and fixed data distribution. Discarding this fixed data partitioning assumption, offers the opportunity to create a data distribution that minimizes the number of distributed joins. Recent research focused on data- and query-driven partitioning strategies for both RDF and relational data. In this paper we propose a novel and naive workload-driven approach to data partitioning and investigate the impact of various critical factors on the number of resulting distributed joins. In a preliminary experiment we empirically compare our method to traditional partitioning strategies using a DBpedia query log of 400’000 queries and observe that it can produce up to 50% less distributed joins than an expert (manual) partitioning scheme, 45% less than partitioning based on hashing by subject and up to 83% less distributed joins than just random assignment.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2013,"Poster/Demo Paper",,EOL

In the paper we first revisit PigSPARQL and demonstrate PigSPARQL's gain of efficiency simply because switching from version Pig 0.5.0 to Pig 0.11.0. Because of this sustainability, PigSPARQL is an attractive long-term baseline for comparing various MapReduce based SPARQL implementations. This is underlined by PigSPARQL's competitiveness with existing systems, e.g. HadoopRDF.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2013,"Poster/Demo Paper",,EOL

In this paper, we propose RDFChain which supports the scalable storage and efficient retrieval of a large volume of RDF data using a combination of MapReduce and HBase which is NoSQL storage system. Since the proposed storage schema of RDFChain reflects all the possible join patterns of queries, it provides a reduced number of storage accesses depending on the join pattern of a query. In addition, the proposed cost-based map-side join of RDFChain reduces the number of map jobs since it processes as many joins as possible in a map job using statistics.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2013,"Poster/Demo Paper",,EOL

Then in the contextual tag cloud, the font size of each tag depends on the number of instances that are associated with that tag and all tags in the context. Each contextual tag cloud serves as a summary of the distribution of relevant data, and by changing the context, the user can quickly gain an understanding of patterns in the data. Furthermore, the user can choose to include RDFS taxonomic and/or domain/range entailment in the calculations of tag sizes, thereby understanding the impact of semantics on the data.

For users, the key question is how often they will encounter those pathological inputs in practice, that is, how robust are reasoners. We attempt to determine this question for classification of existing ontologies as they are found on the Web. It is a fairly common user task to examine ontologies published on the Web as part of their development process. Thus, the robustness of reasoners in this scenario is both directly interesting and provides some hints toward answering the broader question.

To ensure scalability most distributed systems partition the data and distribute the workload among multiple machines. This approach does, however, raise the question how the data and the workload should be partitioned and distributed. A uniform scheduling strategy---a uniform distribution of computation load among available machines---typically used by stream processing systems, disregards network-load as one of the major bottlenecks for throughput resulting in an immense load in terms of inter-machine communication. We propose a graph-partitioning based approach for workload scheduling within stream processing systems.We implemented a distributed triple-stream processing engine on top of the Storm realtime computation framework and evaluate its communication behavior using two real-world datasets. We show that the application of graph partitioning algorithms can decrease inter-machine communication substantially (by 40% to 99%) whilst maintaining an even workload distribution, even using very limited data statistics.

Theexploitation of available background knowledge is a key element in this scenario.In this paper we introduce a novel method for the semantic interpretation of humanbehavior in mobility based on the merge of the mobile network data streamand the geo-referred available background knowledge. We modeled the humanbehavior making use of the geo and time-referenced knowledge available on theweb (e.g., geo-tagged resources, info on weather forecast, social events, etc.)matching it with the mobile network coverage map. The model is intended tocharacterize the contexts where the mobile network events occur in order to helpin interpreting the behavioral traits that generated by them. This will allow us toachieve a set of predictive tasks such as the prediction of human activities in certain contextual conditions (e.g., when an accident occurs on highway before theworking time starts, etc.), or the characterization of exceptional events detectedfrom anomalies in mobile network data.We created an ontological and stochastic high-level representation behavioralmodel (HRBModel) that maps the human activities to the different contexts.Given the mobile phone network and the geo-tagged resource Openstreetmap,the model is used to rank the activities associated to a particular network event(e.g. a sudden call amount peak) according to their probability.

"Yevgeny Kazakov, Pavel Klinov","The Benefits of Incremental Reasoning in OWL EL",,2013,,,http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2013/poster-demo-proceedings,,,,"This demo will present the advantages of the new, bookkeeping-free method for incremental reasoning in OWL EL on incremental classification of large ontologies. In particular, we will show how a typical experience of a user editing a large ontology can be improved if the reasoner (or ontology IDE) provides the capability of instantaneously re-classifying the ontology in the background mode when a change is made. In addition, we intend to demonstrate how incremental reasoning helps in other tasks such as answering DL queries and computing explanations of entailments. We will use our OWL EL reasoner ELK and its Protege plug-in as the main tools to highlight these benefits.",http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2013,"Poster/Demo Paper",,EOL
