Stream and rank-aware data management techniques are progressively providing reactive and reliable query answering over such massive datasets, allowing integration of highly dynamic sources. Key to their success is the use of streaming algorithms that harness the natural or enforceable orders in the data. The expressive power of Semantic technologies is needed in those applications, but Semantic Technologies risk being unable to address the needs of those applications, because they do not consider ordering as an essential property. Ranking results is often seen as an “added task”, performed after inference, without affecting the inference process, which is order-agnostic. However, we perceive a trend towards order-aware semantic technologies: both researchers and practitioners understand that order matters in reasoning over massive and highly dynamic data. The idea of Stream Reasoning is gaining considerable momentum. Some top-k query answering techniques for Linked Data appeared. Several works are considering SPARQL query answering on RDF annotated with labels partially ordered. The Description Logic community is investigating top-k ontological query answering.

However, the massive quantity requires efficient learning algorithms and the unguaranteed quality of data requires robust methods to handle redundancy and noise.LD4IE intends to gather researchers and practitioners to address multiple challenges arising from the usage of LD as learning material for IE tasks, focusing on (i) modelling user defined extraction tasks using LD; (ii) gathering learning materials from LD assuring quality (training data selection, cleaning, feature selection etc.); (iii) robust learning algorithms for handling LD; (iv) publishing IE results to the LOD cloud.",http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/ld4ie,http://oak.dcs.shef.ac.uk/ld4ie2013/index.html,,http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/workshops,EOL

However this transparency comes at a price: the loss of our privacy. There has been growing awareness within the community of the need to address privacy and security concerns. To date the focus has been on researching specific privacy and security models and frameworks, for example for access control, obfuscation, anonymization, aggregation, licensing, etc. However we are “putting the cart before the horse”, we need to identify clear privacy and security requirements before proposing technical solutions. With this workshop we aim at the following goals: First, raise awareness that the technologies the community are working on have global societal consequences. Vice versa, our research can be guided by determining a road map for desirable privacy goals. We aim to determine first steps towards identifying desirable goals. Second, raise awareness of interconnections between the different communities that are involved in Web privacy and security ­ e.g., policy makers, users, social sciences and computer scientists and provide a platform for interconnection and communication. Third, determine the next steps that need to be conducted in order to broaden the level of engagement between the relevant parties.",http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/privon-2013,http://privon.semanticweb.org/,,http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/workshops,EOL

Their development and deployment shows the steady maturing of semantic technologies and demonstrates their value in solving current and emerging problems. Examples include enabling generic clients, facilitating autonomous agents and large scale distributed data integration. Despite the encouraging figures, the number of enterprises working on and with these technologies is dwarfed by the large number who have not yet adopted semantic technologies. Current adoption is mainly restricted to methodologies provided by the research community. Although Semantic Web acts as candidate technology to the industry, it does not win through in current enterprise challenges like data fusion, data integration or natural language processing (e.g. IBM Watson).

While there have been some notable wins (such as RSS and FOAF), many of the other initiatives have seen little industry adoption. Learning from these earlier attempts has guided the development of schema.org, which appears to have altered the trajectory. Two years after its launch over 4 million Internet domains are are using schema.org markup. In this talk, we recount the history behind the early efforts and try to understand why some of them succeeded while others failed. We will then give an update on Schema.org, its goals, accomplishments and where it is headed.

In response, and based on our accumulated experience over the last decade and a maturing of several key semantic web approaches, we have adapted, extended, and integrated several open source applications and frameworks that handle major portions of functionality for these platforms. At minimum, these functions include: an object-type repository, collaboration tools, an ability to identify and manage all key entities in the platform, and an integrated portal to manage diverse content and applications, with varied access levels and privacy options. At the same time, there is increasing attention to how researchers present and explain results based on interpretation of increasingly diverse and heterogeneous data and information sources. With the renewed emphasis on good data practices, informatics practitioners have responded to this challenge with maturing informatics-based approaches. These approaches include, but are not limited to, use case development; information modeling and architectures; elaborating vocabularies; mediating interfaces to data and related services on the Web; and traceable provenance. The current era of data-intensive research presents numerous challenges to both individuals and research teams. In environmental science especially, sub-fields that were data-poor are becoming data-rich (volume, type and mode), while some that were largely model/ simulation driven are now dramatically shifting to data-driven or least to data-model assimilation approaches. These paradigm shifts make it very hard for researchers used to one mode to shift to another, let alone produce products of their work that are usable or understandable by non-specialists. However, it is exactly at these frontiers where much of the exciting environmental science needs to be performed and appreciated. XVIII Research networks (even small ones) need to deal with people, and many intellectual artifacts produced or consumed in research, organizational and/our outreach activities, as well as the relations among them. Increasingly these networks are modeled as knowledge networks, i.e. graphs with named and typed relations among the 'nodes'. Some important nodes are: people, organizations, datasets, events, presentations, publications, videos, meetings, reports, groups, and more. In this heterogeneous ecosystem, it is important to use a set of common informatics approaches to co-design and co-evolve the needed science data platforms based on what real people want to use them for. We present our methods and results for information modeling, adapting, integrating and evolving a networked data science and information architecture based on several open source technologies (e.g. Drupal, VIVO, the Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network; CKAN, and the Global Handle System; GHS) and many semantic technologies. We discuss the results in the context of the Deep Carbon Virtual Observatory and the Global Change Information System, and conclude with musings on how the smart mediation among the components is modeled and managed, and its general applicability and ecacy.",http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/keynote-peter-fox,,,,

We are developing hypothesis-based query interfaces that provide evidence to validate or refute hypotheses and decision support services that recommend the optimum actions given current or predicted scenarios. We are using ontologies to influence and adapt government policies by linking policy-driven implementations, investments and management actions to real world indicators. Through evaluation of the methods and assessment of the achievements associated with the OzTrack, eReef, Skeletome and Twentieth Century in Paint projects, I will highlight those Semantic Web technologies that have worked for us and our user communities, those that haven't and those that need improvement.
