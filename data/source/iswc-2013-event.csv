Stream and rank-aware data management techniques are progressively providing reactive and reliable query answering over such massive datasets, allowing integration of highly dynamic sources. Key to their success is the use of streaming algorithms that harness the natural or enforceable orders in the data. The expressive power of Semantic technologies is needed in those applications, but Semantic Technologies risk being unable to address the needs of those applications, because they do not consider ordering as an essential property. Ranking results is often seen as an “added task”, performed after inference, without affecting the inference process, which is order-agnostic. However, we perceive a trend towards order-aware semantic technologies: both researchers and practitioners understand that order matters in reasoning over massive and highly dynamic data. The idea of Stream Reasoning is gaining considerable momentum. Some top-k query answering techniques for Linked Data appeared. Several works are considering SPARQL query answering on RDF annotated with labels partially ordered. The Description Logic community is investigating top-k ontological query answering.

Linked Data (LD) defines best practices for exposing, sharing, and connecting data, information, and knowledge on the Semantic Web using uniform means such as URIs and RDF. It has so far been created a gigantic knowledge source of Linked Open Data (LOD), which constitutes a mine of learning materials for IE. However, the massive quantity requires efficient learning algorithms and the unguaranteed quality of data requires robust methods to handle redundancy and noise.LD4IE intends to gather researchers and practitioners to address multiple challenges arising from the usage of LD as learning material for IE tasks, focusing on (i) modelling user defined extraction tasks using LD; (ii) gathering learning materials from LD assuring quality (training data selection, cleaning, feature selection etc.); (iii) robust learning algorithms for handling LD; (iv) publishing IE results to the LOD cloud.",http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/ld4ie,http://oak.dcs.shef.ac.uk/ld4ie2013/index.html,,http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/workshops,EOL

This brings unprecedented advantages, assists humans, organisations and systems with problem solving, enables innovation and increases productivity. It makes everything more transparent. However this transparency comes at a price: the loss of our privacy. There has been growing awareness within the community of the need to address privacy and security concerns. To date the focus has been on researching specific privacy and security models and frameworks, for example for access control, obfuscation, anonymization, aggregation, licensing, etc. However we are “putting the cart before the horse”, we need to identify clear privacy and security requirements before proposing technical solutions. With this workshop we aim at the following goals: First, raise awareness that the technologies the community are working on have global societal consequences. Vice versa, our research can be guided by determining a road map for desirable privacy goals. We aim to determine first steps towards identifying desirable goals. Second, raise awareness of interconnections between the different communities that are involved in Web privacy and security ­ e.g., policy makers, users, social sciences and computer scientists and provide a platform for interconnection and communication. Third, determine the next steps that need to be conducted in order to broaden the level of engagement between the relevant parties.",http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/privon-2013,http://privon.semanticweb.org/,,http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/workshops,EOL

Their development and deployment shows the steady maturing of semantic technologies and demonstrates their value in solving current and emerging problems. Examples include enabling generic clients, facilitating autonomous agents and large scale distributed data integration. Despite the encouraging figures, the number of enterprises working on and with these technologies is dwarfed by the large number who have not yet adopted semantic technologies. Current adoption is mainly restricted to methodologies provided by the research community. Although Semantic Web acts as candidate technology to the industry, it does not win through in current enterprise challenges like data fusion, data integration or natural language processing (e.g. IBM Watson).

While there have been some notable wins (such as RSS and FOAF), many of the other initiatives have seen little industry adoption. Learning from these earlier attempts has guided the development of schema.org, which appears to have altered the trajectory. Two years after its launch over 4 million Internet domains are are using schema.org markup. In this talk, we recount the history behind the early efforts and try to understand why some of them succeeded while others failed. We will then give an update on Schema.org, its goals, accomplishments and where it is headed.

In response, and based on our accumulated experience over the last decade and a maturing of several key semantic web approaches, we have adapted, extended, and integrated several open source applications and frameworks that handle major portions of functionality for these platforms. At minimum, these functions include: an object-type repository, collaboration tools, an ability to identify and manage all key entities in the platform, and an integrated portal to manage diverse content and applications, with varied access levels and privacy options. At the same time, there is increasing attention to how researchers present and explain results based on interpretation of increasingly diverse and heterogeneous data and information sources. With the renewed emphasis on good data practices, informatics practitioners have responded to this challenge with maturing informatics-based approaches. These approaches include, but are not limited to, use case development; information modeling and architectures; elaborating vocabularies; mediating interfaces to data and related services on the Web; and traceable provenance. The current era of data-intensive research presents numerous challenges to both individuals and research teams. In environmental science especially, sub-fields that were data-poor are becoming data-rich (volume, type and mode), while some that were largely model/ simulation driven are now dramatically shifting to data-driven or least to data-model assimilation approaches. These paradigm shifts make it very hard for researchers used to one mode to shift to another, let alone produce products of their work that are usable or understandable by non-specialists. However, it is exactly at these frontiers where much of the exciting environmental science needs to be performed and appreciated. XVIII Research networks (even small ones) need to deal with people, and many intellectual artifacts produced or consumed in research, organizational and/our outreach activities, as well as the relations among them. Increasingly these networks are modeled as knowledge networks, i.e. graphs with named and typed relations among the 'nodes'. Some important nodes are: people, organizations, datasets, events, presentations, publications, videos, meetings, reports, groups, and more. In this heterogeneous ecosystem, it is important to use a set of common informatics approaches to co-design and co-evolve the needed science data platforms based on what real people want to use them for. We present our methods and results for information modeling, adapting, integrating and evolving a networked data science and information architecture based on several open source technologies (e.g. Drupal, VIVO, the Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network; CKAN, and the Global Handle System; GHS) and many semantic technologies. We discuss the results in the context of the Deep Carbon Virtual Observatory and the Global Change Information System, and conclude with musings on how the smart mediation among the components is modeled and managed, and its general applicability and ecacy.",http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/keynote-peter-fox,,,,

In each of these use cases, we are integrating multi-modal data streams across space, time, disciplines, formats and agencies to infer and expose new knowledge through rich multi-layered and interactive visualizations. We are developing hypothesis-based query interfaces that provide evidence to validate or refute hypotheses and decision support services that recommend the optimum actions given current or predicted scenarios. We are using ontologies to influence and adapt government policies by linking policy-driven implementations, investments and management actions to real world indicators. Through evaluation of the methods and assessment of the achievements associated with the OzTrack, eReef, Skeletome and Twentieth Century in Paint projects, I will highlight those Semantic Web technologies that have worked for us and our user communities, those that haven't and those that need improvement. Finally, I will discuss what I believe will be the major outstanding research challenges facing Semantic Big Data in the next 5 years and those research areas with the greatest potential for impact.",http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/keynote-jane-hunter,,,,

Reproducibility underpins the scientific method: at least in principle if not practice. The willing exchange of results and the transparent conduct of research can only be expected up to a point in a competitive environment. Contributions to science are acknowledged, but not if the credit is for data curation or software. From a bioinformatics view point, how far could our results be reproducible before the pain is just too high? Is open science a dangerous, utopian vision or a legitimate, feasible expectation? How do we move bioinformatics from one where results are post-hoc “made reproducible”, to pre-hoc “born reproducible”? And why, in our computational information age, do we communicate results through fragmented, fixed documents rather than cohesive, versioned releases? In this talk, which I gave as a keynote at the 2013 joint conference Intelligent Systems in Molecular Biology / European Conference on Computational Biology, I will explore these questions drawing on 20 years of experience in both the development of technical infrastructure for Life Science and the social infrastructure in which Life Science operates.",,,,,

Semantic Web languages can represent controlled vocabularies and shared annotations of media content on the Web. By identifying concepts to consider, Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) are the building blocks of the Semantic Web. Often, particular regions of an image or particular sequences of an audio or a video resource need to be localized and uniquely identified in order to be used as subject or object resource in an RDF annotation. In this talk, we will first present the Media Fragment URI specification, a recent W3C recommendation that enables to uniquely identifying sub-parts of media assets in the same way that the fragment identifier in the URI can refer to part of an HTML or XML document. We will then describe models and ontologies that we will illustrate with several real world applications using semantic annotations attached to media fragments in the music and the TV domains. Those applications are developed in the context of the European projects LinkedTV and MediaMixer and the French project WAVE.",,,,http://semanticmedia.org.uk/smam2013/#programme,EOL

At the same time we see increasing computational power and storage: more devices, more processors, more cores (indeed Moore’s Law). An interesting space, generating considerable activity, is where large numbers of people meet large numbers of machines – where new forms of data are produced and also where the new analytics occur, from computational algorithms to citizen science. Underpinning this space is the notion of Social Machines, defined by Tim Berners-Lee as processes in which the people do the creative work and the machine does the administration. The theory and practice of Social Machines are now attracting study, and this talk will discuss this opportunity for Semantic Web approaches to underpin the design and construction of future Social Machines against a backdrop of increasing scale and increasing automation.",,,,http://crowdsem.wordpress.com/program-and-proceedings/,EOL

Detecting and classifying named entities has traditionally been taken on by the natural language processing community, whilst linking of entities to external knowledge bases such as DBpedia has been tackled by the Semantic Web community. In this talk, we will first describe NERD, an open source platform for extracting and disambiguating named entities in textual documents. We will report some joy and disillusions when benchmarking NERD on standard corpora such as CoNLL, ETAPE, MSM or TAC KBP that consist of very diverse textual documents ranging from microposts, newswire articles or transcripts of TV shows. We will finally present some applications in which named entities are pivotal for structuring and enriching multimedia content.",,,,http://nlp-dbpedia2013.blogs.aksw.org/program/,EOL

This talk addresses the question of how to understand such data in terms of activities which are taking place between the agents/objects involved which may involve temporally and/or spatially overlapping activites. Of particular interest are unsupervised technqniques so that the kinds of events and interactions can be mined with little or no supervision. I will present techniques for learning the spatio-temporal structure of tasks and events from video or other sensor data and show how this can be characterised using qualitative spatio-temporal descriptions to produce a high level symbolic description of the activities present.",,,,,
