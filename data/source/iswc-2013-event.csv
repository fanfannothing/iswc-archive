Stream and rank-aware data management techniques are progressively providing reactive and reliable query answering over such massive datasets, allowing integration of highly dynamic sources. Key to their success is the use of streaming algorithms that harness the natural or enforceable orders in the data. The expressive power of Semantic technologies is needed in those applications, but Semantic Technologies risk being unable to address the needs of those applications, because they do not consider ordering as an essential property. Ranking results is often seen as an “added task”, performed after inference, without affecting the inference process, which is order-agnostic. However, we perceive a trend towards order-aware semantic technologies: both researchers and practitioners understand that order matters in reasoning over massive and highly dynamic data. The idea of Stream Reasoning is gaining considerable momentum. Some top-k query answering techniques for Linked Data appeared. Several works are considering SPARQL query answering on RDF annotated with labels partially ordered. The Description Logic community is investigating top-k ontological query answering. This workshop aims at bringing together this growing and very active community interested in integrating ordering with reasoning by using methods inspired by stream and rank-aware data management.

This is complemented by an even larger number of fixed sensors recording observations of a wide variety of modalities. Geographically distributed sensor nodes are capable of forming ad hoc networking topologies, with nodes expected to be dynamically inserted and removed from a network. The sensors are increasingly being connected with Web infrastructure, and the Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standard developed by the Open Geospatial Consortium is widely being adopted in industry, government and academia alike. While such frameworks provide some interoperability, semantics is increasingly seen as key enabler for integration of sensor data and broader Web information systems. Analytical and reasoning capabilities afforded by Semantic Web standards and technologies are considered important for developing advanced applications that go from capturing observations to recognition of events and ultimately developing comprehensive situational awareness. Defense, transportation, global enterprise, and natural resource management industries are leading the rapid emergence of applications in commercial, civic, and scientific operations that involve sensors, web, services and semantics. Semantic technologies are often proposed as important components of complex, cross-jurisdictional, heterogeneous, dynamic information systems.

In particular, semantic technologies have been deployed in the context of a wide range of information management tasks in scenarios that are increasingly significant in both technical (data size, variety and complexity of data sources) and economical terms (industries addressed and their market volume). For many of these tasks, machine-driven algorithmic techniques aiming at full automation do not reach a level of accuracy that many production environments require.
