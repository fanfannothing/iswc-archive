XQuery is a declarative query language that uses the structure of XML intelligently. It can express queries across all these kinds of data, whether physically stored in XML or viewed as XML via middleware and it is designed to be broadly applicable across many types of XML data sources, independently of their original format or location. XQuery is currently under standardization as part of the World Wide Web Consortium and already adopted by industry, research and open source communities alike. Given that it is likely that large amounts of information will be represented in near future using XML, XQuery will play a fundamental role for data search, integration and aggregation; it will be the basic building block for such activities. XQuery is currently and will be in the future used in a variety of different environments. Examples to date include XML database systems, XML document repositories, XML data integration on the Web and within single economical structures, workflow systems, and publish and subscribe systems. In addition, XPath of which XQuery is a superset is used in various products such as Web browsers. Although the W3C XQuery specification has not yet attained recommendation status, and the definition of the language has not entirely stabilized, a number of alternative proposals to implement and optimize XQuery have appeared both in industry and in the research community. Given the wide range of applications for which XQuery is applicable, a wide spectrum of alternative techniques has been proposed for XQuery processing. Some of these techniques are only useful for certain applications, other techniques are general-purpose.",http://iswc2004.semanticweb.org/CFParticipation/T1.html,,,http://iswc2004.semanticweb.org/CFParticipation/T1.html,EOL

Noy, Holger Knublauch, Mark A. Musen",,,,"The Task Force on Ontology Engineering and Patterns of the W3C working group on Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment will have completed most of its work by the time of the conference. The Task Force has already produced a series of first working draft notes on common ontology design patterns. These patterns analogous to the programming design patterns used by software engineers are directly influencing the development of the Protégé-OWL ontology development environment and its extensions by the CO-ODE project. This tutorial will introduce attendees to the concept of ontology patterns and discuss key patterns developed by the Task Force and others. Example patterns include quantities and units, value partitions, n-nary relations, problems of distinguishing classes and individuals, the choice between representing relationships as classes or properties, and qualified cardinality restrictions. (The final choice of issues will be driven by the results of the Task Force.) The tutorial will provide practical hands-on experience with the patterns using the Protégé-OWL tools and CO-ODE extensions. The style of the tutorial will be lecture demonstration. The software and examples will be made available in advance and attendees will be encouraged to gain hands on experience and explore the trade-offs between alternative patterns by working through the examples on their laptops. (See http://protege.stanford.edu and http://www.co-ode.org) The quality, availability and breadth of coverage of ontologies will be a major factor in determining the success of the Semantic Web. Patterns and tools to make it easier to develop high quality ontologies is therefore crucial to the Semantic Web Development. However, the idea of ontology patterns is relatively new. Many controversies remain. Ample time will be provided for feedback, questions and discussion. Three of the proposers are members of the Task Force, and one of them, Guus Schreiber, chairs the W3C Working Group.",http://iswc2004.semanticweb.org/CFParticipation/T2.html,,,http://iswc2004.semanticweb.org/CFParticipation/T2.html,EOL

Web Services are also offered across Grid Computing in support of e-science. Recent industrial interest in Web Services, Semantic Web and the availability of tools and standards to enable automated invocation of business functionality through message exchange (e.g. SOAP, UDDI, WSDL, BEPL etc) holds the promise of fast progress in this area. An increasing number of Web Services using basic semantics are starting to appear. Today, services (e.g. travel services, book selling services, stock reporting services etc) are discovered and invoked manually by human users. In the near future, such service discovery and use will be mediated by computational entities, thus making the Web and Web Services computer understandable. Instead of being populated with human-readable documents, the Web will be populated with computer-mediated services. This tutorial will take an in-depth look at the current state of the art in the Semantic Web and Web Services and sort through the increasing and confusing array of relevant tools, languages and theories both from academia and industry. The tutorial will also present and discuss semantics for Web Services and their potential for business value added. Many examples to illustrate the described concepts, techniques, tools and their use will be presented. The tutorial brings together material and tools from the Semantic Web and Web Service standards technologies. In addition, the tutorial will present different approaches for enhancing Web Services with semantics. More importantly, the tutorial will discuss limitations of current technologies and present value added advanced concepts, such as distributed service composition, Semantic Web enabled Web Services, agent-mediated Web Services, as well as open issues that must be addressed. Alternative approaches will be presented and compared and a substantial list of references will be provided. The tutorial is self contained and accessible to practitioners, researchers and students. In particular this tutorial will focus on presenting semantics for Web Services with illustrations from two approaches, OWL-S and WSMO, that will be presented concurrently in order to emphasize their commonalities and differences. OWL-S (http://www.daml.org/services/owl-s/) is an effort supported by DARPA and is part of the DAML program. WSMO (http://www.wsmo.org) is an effort supported by European national and international projects.",http://iswc2004.semanticweb.org/CFParticipation/T3.html,,,http://iswc2004.semanticweb.org/CFParticipation/T3.html,EOL
