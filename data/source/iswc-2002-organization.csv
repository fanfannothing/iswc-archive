"DAML: DARPA Agent Markup Language Program",,,https://files.ifi.uzh.ch/ddis/iswc_archive/iswc/ih/ISWC-2002/logos/logo-daml.jpg,http://www.daml.org/,"The World Wide Web (WWW) contains a large amount information which is expanding at a rapid rate. Most of that information is currently being represented using the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which is designed to allow web developers to display information in a way that is accessible to humans for viewing via web browsers. While HTML allows us to visualize the information on the web, it doesn't provide much capability to describe the information in ways that facilitate the use of software programs to find or interpret it. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has developed the Extensible Markup Language (XML) which allows information to be more accurately described using tags. As an example, the word Algol on a web site might represent a computer language, a star or an oceanographic research ship. The use of XML to provide metadata markup, such as Algol, makes the meaning of the work unambiguous. However, XML has a limited capability to describe the relationships (schemas or ontologies) with respect to objects. The use of ontologies provides a very powerful way to describe objects and their relationships to other objects. The DAML language is being developed as an extension to XML and the Resource Description Framework (RDF). The latest release of the language (DAML+OIL) provides a rich set of constructs with which to create ontologies and to markup information so that it is machine readable and understandable.",[ME],swc:Sponsor,"Organizing Institution",https://files.ifi.uzh.ch/ddis/iswc_archive/iswc/ih/ISWC-2002/sponsors.html,EOL
"OntoWeb: Ontology-based information exchange for knowledge management and electronic commerce",,,https://files.ifi.uzh.ch/ddis/iswc_archive/iswc/ih/SWWS-2001/logos/ontoweb1a.jpg,http://www.ontoweb.org/,"Currently computers are changing from single isolated devices into entry points into a worldwide network of information exchange and business transactions. Support in data, information, and knowledge exchange is becoming the key issue in current computer technology. Ontologies will play a major role in supporting information exchange processes in various areas. They will enable the semantic web which provides on-line access to large volumes of information and knowledge based on machine-processable semantics of data.  In consequence, there is a large interest in these topics from various sites. Different research communities develop their subject into this direction; many commercial agents encounter the economical potential of the topic and many funding agencies are willing to provide significant support for its development. Still the different communities are scattered and have not yet found enough interactions to fully employ the potential of this new technology. It is the delighted goal of the OntoWeb network to bypass communication bottlenecks between these various and heterogeneous interest groups. Ontoweb set up a homepage, a mailing list, and organizes a European workshop coordinating projects proposals for the next open calls of the European Union IST funding. Ontoweb is a thematic network of the European Union IST programme.

NetworkInference,,,https://files.ifi.uzh.ch/ddis/iswc_archive/iswc/ih/ISWC-2002/logos/netinf.jpg,http://www.networkinference.com/,"Network Inference addresses a serious discontinuity that enterprises are about to face in their technology roadmap. Existing 'Relational Database Management Systems' (RDBMS) and XML-based solutions are not able to represent semantic data, and as a result, the demand for efficient, complex data structures capable of storing, querying and communicating semantic data is set to grow. Network Inference's advanced Description Logic products, together with associated standards being developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), will allow enterprise and web based information and services to be machine interpretable and use-apparent. This will enable the full promise of Web Services, e-commerce and distributed information retrieval to be realised. Our family of products - CerebraÂ¨ - will reduce the cost involved in the development and maintenance of complex data driven applications, significantly reducing their processing overhead and vastly expanding their representational power. Network Inference is creating software products and promoting the development of web standards that, together, will power the advance of machine understanding and reduce the level of human processing involved in web-based applications. As the proliferation of content continues, the burden on human processing on the web is becoming prohibitive. As corporate systems look to exploit the WWW more fully there is a growing need to facilitate interaction and interoperability between applications. XML is a step in the right direction, but only a small step. Armed with the capacity for complex, machine understandable representations that Network Inference will introduce, corporate systems will progress beyond the simple structures of the relational database, allowing them to understand enough to relieve the burden on human processing. Our vision is shared by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Their Semantic Web Activity is seeking to develop common standards, above XML, for the interchange of semantic data (an ontology language). The technology and personnel of Network Inference are at the core of the W3C and its Semantic Web activity.",[ME],swc:Sponsor,"Platinum Sponsor",https://files.ifi.uzh.ch/ddis/iswc_archive/iswc/ih/ISWC-2002/sponsors.html,EOL

The On-To-Knowledge tools will help knowledge workers who are not IT specialists to access company-wide information repositories in an effcient, natural and intuitive way. Ontologies provide a shared and common understanding of a domain that can be communicated across people and application systems. Therefore, they will play a major role in supporting information exchange processes in various areas.

This development will help us to achieve Web content by previously inaccessible means. We are looking forward to finding the future Web landscape presented according to our vision. An environment that understands our language, that supports our objectives, and our way of reaching those objectives. Collections of applications and tools that create flexible workplaces. A medium that can readily be integrated into personal knowledge landscapes. A platform that allows for the easy exchange of ideas.

"WonderWeb: Ontology Infrastructure for the Semantic Web",,,https://files.ifi.uzh.ch/ddis/iswc_archive/iswc/ih/ISWC-2002/logos/logo-wonder.gif,http://wonderweb.semanticweb.org,"We are on the brink of a new generation of World Wide Web (WWW) which, in his recent book Weaving the Web, Tim Berners-Lee calls the Semantic Web. Unlike the existing WWW, where data is primarily intended for human consumption, the Semantic Web will provide data that is also machine processable. This will enable a wide range of intelligent services such as information brokers, search agents, information filters etc., a process that Berners-Lee describes as ""Bringing the Web to its full potential"". The development of ontologies will be central to this effort. Ontologies are meta data, providing a controlled vocabulary of terms, each with an explicitly defined and machine processable semantics. By defining shared and common domain theories, ontologies help both people and machines to communicate more effectively. They will therefore have a crucial role in enabling content-based access, interoperability and communication across the Web, providing it with a qualitatively new level of service: the Semantic Web. The importance of ontologies to the Semantic Web has prompted the development of schema extensions to existing Web standard languages: XML has been extended to give XML-Schema (XMLS), while RDF has been extended to give RDF-Schema (RDFS). However, the language primitives provided by these standards are extremely basic when compared with those typically provided by ontology languages developed within the Knowledge Representation (KR) community, and efforts are already underway to develop ontology extensions of these standards. The aim of the project is to develop the infrastructure required for the large-scale deployment of ontologies as the foundation for the Semantic Web. This will involve not only the establishment of a Web standard ontology language, but also the parallel development of the ontological engineering technology that will be required in order to ""bring the web to its full potential"".",[ME],swc:Sponsor,"Gold Sponsor",https://files.ifi.uzh.ch/ddis/iswc_archive/iswc/ih/ISWC-2002/sponsors.html,EOL
