Current Data Mining (DM) systems enable the user to manually design workflows but this becomes difficult when there are too many operators to choose from or the workflow's size is too large. Therefore we propose to use auto-experimentation based on ontological planning to provide the users with automatic generated workflows as well as rankings for workflows based on several criteria (execution time, accuracy, etc.). Moreover autoexperimentation will help to validate the generated workflows and to prune and reduce their number. Furthermore we will use mixed-initiative planning to allow the users to set parameters and criteria to limit the planning search space as well as to guide the planner towards better workflows.", "author": "Floarea Serban", "topics": "", "proceedings_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2010/proceedings-2", "cnt_topic": "0", "cnt_url": "2", "list_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-17749-1_22,http://iswc2010.semanticweb.org/pdf/451.pdf", "year": "2010", "keywords": "", "list_author": "Floarea Serban", "cnt_author": "1", "paper_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2010/proceedings-2/paper-03", "pages": "313-320", "cnt_keyword": "0", "label_proceedings": "The Semantic Web - ISWC 2010"}, {"category": "Doctoral Consortium Paper", "link_publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-17749-1_23", "link_open_access": "http://iswc2010.semanticweb.org/pdf/445.pdf", "title": "Customizing the Composition of Actions, Programs, and Web Services with User Preferences", "subtitle_proceedings": "9th International Semantic Web Conference, ISWC 2010, Shanghai, China, November 7-11, 2010, Revised Selected Papers, Part II", "abstract": "Web service composition (WSC) - loosely, the composition of web-accessible software systems - requires a computer program to automatically select, integrate, and invoke multiple web services in order to achieve a user-defined objective. It is an example of the more general task of composing business processes or component-based software. Our doctoral research endeavours to make fundamental contributions to the knowledge representation and reasoning principles underlying the task of WSC, with a particular focus on the customization of compositions with respect to individual preferences. The setting for our work is the semantic web, where the properties and functioning of services and data are described in a computer-interpretable form. In this setting we conceive of WSC as an Artificial Intelligence planning task. This enables us to bring to bear many of the theoretical and computational advances in reasoning about action and planning to the task of WSC. However, WSC goes far beyond the reaches of classical planning, presenting a number of interesting challenges that are relevant not only to WSC but to a large body of problems related to the composition of actions, programs, business processes, and services.

And I believe it will be of similar importance to the semantic web. Once you are talking about searching from billions of objects, it will be impossible to always give a single right result, no matter how intelligent the search engine is. Instead, a set of possible results will be provided for the user to choose from. Moreover, if we consider the trade-off between the system costs of generating a single right result and a set of possible results, we may choose the latter. This will naturally lead to the question of how to decide on and present the set to the user and how to evaluate the outcome. In this presentation, I will talk about some new results in the methodology and technology developed for evaluation of web search technologies and systems. As we know, the dominant method for evaluating search engines is the Cranfield paradigm, which employs a test collection to qualify the systems' performance. However, the modern search engines are much different than the traditional information retrieval systems when the Cranfield paradigm was proposed: 1. Mostmodernsearchengineshavemuchmorefeatures,suchasquery-dependent document snippets and query suggestions, and the quality of such features can affect the users' effectiveness to find out useful information; 2. The document collections used in search engines are much larger than ever, so the complete test collection that contain all query-document judgments is not available. As response to the above differences and difficulties, the evaluation based on implicit feedback is a promising alternative methodology employed in IR evaluation. With this approach, no extra human effort is required to judge the querydocument relevance. Instead, such judgments information can be automatically predicted from real users' implicit feedback data. There are three key issues in this methodology: 1. How to predict the query-document relevance and other useful features that useful to qualify the search engine performance; 2. If the complete \"judgments\" are not available, how can we efficiently collect the most critical information that can determine the system performance; 3. Because more than query-document relevance features can affect the performance, how can they integrate to be a good metric to predict the system performance. We will show a set of technologies dealing with these issues. While semantic web search may present different requirements from web search, evaluation of any search technology will be inevitable. As such, I hope the materials covered in the talk will benefit some of you in semantic web community in the future.", "author": "Jing He and Xiaoming Li", "topics": "", "proceedings_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2010/proceedings-2", "cnt_topic": "0", "cnt_url": "2", "list_url": "http://iswc2010.semanticweb.org/pdf/901.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-17749-1_26", "year": "2010", "keywords": "", "list_author": "Jing He;Xiaoming Li", "cnt_author": "2", "paper_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2010/proceedings-2/paper-07", "pages": "339-354", "cnt_keyword": "0", "label_proceedings": "The Semantic Web - ISWC 2010"}, {"category": "Invited Talk Paper", "link_publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-17749-1_27", "link_open_access": "http://iswc2010.semanticweb.org/pdf/902.pdf", "title": "Semantic Technology at The New York Times: Lessons Learned and Future Directions", "subtitle_proceedings": "9th International Semantic Web Conference, ISWC 2010, Shanghai, China, November 7-11, 2010, Revised Selected Papers, Part II", "abstract": "At last year's International Semantic Web Conference, The New York Times Company announced the release of our Linked Open Data Platform available at http://data.nytimes.com.

By opening up data beyond the now familiar hand crafted Web 2 mash up of data about X plus geography, what are we trying to do, really? Is the goal at least in part to enable net citizens rather than only geeks the ability to pick up, explore, blend, interogate and represent data sources so that we may draw our own statistically informed conclusions about information, and thereby build new knowledge in ways not readily possible before without access to these data seas? If we want citizens rather than just scientists or statisticians or journalists for that matter to be able to pour over data and ask statistically sophisticated questions of comparison and contrast betewen times, places and people, does that mission re-order our research priorities at all? If the goal is to enpower citizens to be able to make use of data, what do we need to make this vision real beyond attending to Tim Berners-Lee's call to \"free your data\"? The purpose of this talk therefore will be to look at key interaction issues around defining and delivering a useful, usable *data explorotron* for citizens. In particular, we'll consider who is a \"citizen user\" and what access to and tools for linked data sense making means in this case. From that perspective, we'll consider research issues around discovery, exploration, interrogation and representation of data for not only a single wild data source but especially for multiple wild heterogeneous data sources. I hope this talk may help frame some stepping stones towards useful and usable interaction with linked data, and look forward to input from the community to refine such a new literacy agenda further.", "author": "m. c. schraefel", "topics": "", "proceedings_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2010/proceedings-2", "cnt_topic": "0", "cnt_url": "2", "list_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-17749-1_28,http://iswc2010.semanticweb.org/pdf/903.pdf", "year": "2010", "keywords": "", "list_author": "m. c. schraefel", "cnt_author": "1", "paper_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2010/proceedings-2/paper-27", "pages": "356-369", "cnt_keyword": "0", "label_proceedings": "The Semantic Web - ISWC 2010"}], "title": "Invited Talk Paper"}, {"papers": [{"category": "Semantic Web In Use Track Paper", "link_publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-17749-1_9", "link_open_access": "http://iswc2010.semanticweb.org/pdf/388.pdf", "title": "A Case Study of Linked Enterprise Data", "subtitle_proceedings": "9th International Semantic Web Conference, ISWC 2010, Shanghai, China, November 7-11, 2010, Revised Selected Papers, Part II", "abstract": "Even though its adoption in the enterprise environment lags behind the public domain, semantic (web) technologies, more recently the linked data initiative, started to penetrate into business domain with more and more people recognising the benefit of such technologies.

With increased use of these technologies, their maturation not only in terms of performance, robustness but also with regard to support of non-latin-based languages and regional differences is of paramount importance. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the current state of the internationalization (I18n) of Semantic Web technologies. Since resource identifiers play a crucial role for the Semantic Web, the internatinalization of resource identifiers is of high importance. It turns out that the prevalent resource identification mechanism on the Semantic Web, i.e. URIs, are not sufficient for an efficient internationalization of knowledge bases.

We discuss the design, in particular how free, wiki-style semantic annotations and guided input along a predefined schema can be combined to create a flexible, extensible, and structured knowledge representation.

The Live Social Semantics application is a novel platform that dissolves this divide, by collecting and integrating data about people from (a) their online social networks and tagging activities from popular social networking sites, (b) their publications and co-authorship networks from semantic repositories, and (c) their real-world face-to-face contacts with other attendees collected via a network of wearable active sensors. This paper investigates the data collected by this application during its deployment at three major conferences, where it was used by more than 400 people.

While similarity only considers subsumption relations to assess how two objects are alike, relatedness takes into account a broader range of relations (e.g., part-of). In this paper, we present a framework, which maps the feature-based model of similarity into the information theoretic domain. A new way of computing IC values directly from an ontology structure is also introduced. This new model, called Extended Information Content (eIC) takes into account the whole set of semantic relations defined in an ontology. The proposed framework enables to rewrite existing similarity measures that can be augmented to compute semantic relatedness. Upon this framework, a new measure called FaITH (Feature and Information THeoretic) has been devised.

In this paper, we propose a framework that is grounded on logic and the Local-As-View approach for representing instances of the service selection problem. In our approach,Web services are semantically described using LAV mappings in terms of generic concepts from an ontology, user requests correspond to conjunctive queries on the generic concepts and, in addition, the user may specify a set of preferences that are used to rank the possible solutions to the given request. The LAV formulation allows us to cast the service selection problem as a query rewriting problem that must consider the relationships among the concepts in the ontology and the ranks induced by the preferences. Then, building on related work, we devise an encoding of the resulting query rewriting problem as a logical theory whose models are in correspondence with the solutions of the user request, and in presence of preferences, whose best models are in correspondence with the best-ranked solutions. Thus, by exploiting known properties of modern SAT solvers, we provide an efficient and scalable solution to the service selection problem.

Our framework incorporates both standard notions of approximation based on edit distance and RDFS-based inference rules.

On-demand management operations can be implemented on top of HDT representation. Experiments show that data sets can be compacted in HDT by more than fifteen times the current naive representation, improving parsing and processing while keeping a consistent publication scheme.

However, the notation used is often ambiguous, making automatic interpretation and conversion to rdf or other suitable format difficult.

Machine learning is the preferred technique adopted for many named entity classification methods where the choice of features is critical to final performance. Existing approaches explore only the features derived from the characteristic of the named entity itself or its linguistic context. With the development of the SemanticWeb, a large number of data sources are published and connected across the Web as Linked Open Data (LOD). LOD provides rich a priori knowledge about entity type information, knowledge that can be a valuable asset when used in connection with named entity classification. In this paper, we explore the use of LOD to enhance named entity classification. Our method extracts information from LOD and builds a type knowledge base which is used to score a (named entity string, type) pair. This score is then injected as one or more features into the existing classifier in order to improve its performance.

We review known model and formula-based approaches for evolution of propositional theories. We exhibit limitations of a number of model-based approaches: besides the fact that they are either not expressible in DL-Lite or hard to compute, they intrinsically ignore the structural properties of KBs, which leads to undesired properties of KBs resulting from such an evolution. We also examine proposals on update and revision of DL KBs that adopt the model-based approaches and discuss their drawbacks. We show that known formula-based approaches are also not appropriate for DL-Lite evolution, either due to high complexity of computation, or because the result of such an action of evolution is not expressible in DL-Lite. Building upon the insights gained, we propose two novel formula-based approaches that respect our principles and for which evolution is expressible in DL-Lite.

In this paper, we present concepts and algorithms to analyse and repair the brittleness of the Web of Data. We apply these on a substantial subset of it, the 2010 Billion Triple Challenge dataset. We first distinguish the physical structure of the Web of Data from its semantic structure. For both of these structures, we then calculate their robustness, taking betweenness centrality as a robustness-measure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such robustness-indicators have been calculated for the Web of Data. Finally, we determine which links should be added to the Web of Data in order to improve its robustness most effectively. We are able to determine such links by interpreting the question as a very large optimisation problem and deploying an evolutionary algorithm to solve this problem.

An increasing number of ontologies are available on-line, but an ontology that combines information from many different sources can grow extremely large. As an ontology grows larger, more resources are required to use it, and its response time becomes slower. Thus, we present and evaluate an on-line approach that forgets fragments from an OWL ontology that are infrequently or no longer used, or are cheap to relearn, in terms of time and resources. In order to evaluate our approach, we situate it in a controlled simulation environment, RoboCup OWLRescue, which is an extension of the widely used RoboCup Rescue platform, which enables agents to build ontologies automatically based on the tasks they are required to perform.

This mapping can be defined in many ways. For instance, by describing the application model as a view over the source dataset, by giving mappings in the form of dependencies between the two datasets, or by inference rules that infer the application model from the source dataset. Explicitly formulating these mappings demands a comprehensive understanding of the underlying schemas (RDF ontologies) of the source and target datasets. This task can be supported by integrating the process of schema exploration into the mapping process and help the application designer with finding the implicit relationships that she wants to map. This paper describes Fusion - a framework for closing the gap between the application model and the underlying ontologies in the Linked Data cloud.

In this paper, we present a new approach to performance analysis based on justifications for entailments of OWL ontologies. Justifications are minimal subsets of an ontology that are sufficient for an entailment to hold, and are commonly used to debug OWL ontologies. In JustBench, justifications form the key unit of test, which means that individual justifications are tested for correctness and reasoner performance instead of entire ontologies or random subsets. Justifications are generally small and relatively easy to analyse, which makes them very suitable for transparent analytic micro-benchmarks. Furthermore, the JustBench approach also allows us to isolate reasoner errors and inconsistent behaviour.

To exploit knowledge discovered at run-time, we propose an additional step, explicitly scheduled during query processing, called correct source ranking.

Hashtags have become the means in Twitter to create threads of conversationand to build communities around particular interests.In this paper, we take a first look at whether hashtags behave as strongidentifiers, and thus whether they could serve as identifiers for the Semantic Web.

We look atthe various ways in which hashtags are used, and show through evaluation that our metrics can be applied to detect hashtags that representreal world entities.", "author": "David Laniado and Peter Mika", "topics": "", "proceedings_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2010/proceedings-1", "cnt_topic": "0", "cnt_url": "2", "list_url": "http://iswc2010.semanticweb.org/pdf/352.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-17746-0_30", "year": "2010", "keywords": "", "list_author": "Peter Mika;David Laniado", "cnt_author": "2", "paper_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2010/proceedings-1/paper-26", "pages": "470-485", "cnt_keyword": "0", "label_proceedings": "The Semantic Web - ISWC 2010"}, {"category": "Research Track Paper", "link_publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-17746-0_51", "link_open_access": "http://iswc2010.semanticweb.org/pdf/131.pdf", "title": "Measuring the dynamic bi-directional influence between content and social networks", "subtitle_proceedings": "9th International Semantic Web Conference, ISWC 2010, Shanghai, China, November 7-11, 2010, Revised Selected Papers, Part I", "abstract": "The Social Semantic Web has begun to provide connections between users within social networks and the content they produce across the whole of the Social Web.

The former accounts for known relations between ontologies, while the latter reflects the possibility to perform actions such as instance import or query translation.

We found that for large or deep ontologies (some as large as 500,000 classes) it is hard to say because benchmarks obscure the load-time costs for materialization. Therefore, to expose those costs, we have synthesized a set of more representative ontologies. Secondly, in designing for scalability, how do we manage knowledge over time? By optimizing for data distribution and ontology evolution, we have reduced the population time, including materialization, for the NCBO Resource Index, a knowledge base of 16.4 billion annotations linking 2.4 million terms from 200 ontologies to 3.5 million data elements, from one week to less than one hour for one of the large datasets on the same machine.", "author": "Paea LePendu,Natalya Fridman Noy,Clement Jonquet,Paul R.

However, even some simple iterative graph algorithms do not map nicely to that programming model requiring programmers to shoehorn their problem to the MapReduce model. This paper presents the Signal/Collect programming model for synchronous and asynchronous graph algorithms. We demonstrate that this abstraction can capture the essence of many algorithms on graphs in a concise and elegant way by giving Signal/Collect adaptations of various relevant algorithms. Furthermore, we built and evaluated a prototype Signal/Collect framework that executes algorithms in our pro- gramming model.

In this work, we allow users to express needs in terms of simple keywords. Given the keywords, we define the problem of finding the relevant sources as the one of keyword query routing. As a solution, we present a family of summary models, which compactly represents the Web of linked data and allows to quickly find relevant sources.

However, in the recent years, it becomes evident that one of the most important directions of improvement in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, like word sense disambiguation, coreference resolution, relation extraction, and other tasks related to knowledge extraction, is by exploiting semantics. While in the past, the unavailability of rich and complete semantic descriptions constituted a serious limitation of their applicability, nowadays, the Semantic Web made available a large amount of logically encoded information (e.g. ontologies, RDF(S)-data, linked data, etc.), which constitutes a valuable source of semantics. However, web semantics cannot be easily plugged into machine learning systems. Therefore the objective of this paper is to define a reference methodology for combining semantic information available in the web under the form of logical theories, with statistical methods for NLP. The major problems that we have to solve to implement our methodology concern (i) the selection of the correct and minimal knowledge among the large amount available in the web, (ii) the representation of uncertain knowledge, and (iii) the resolution and the encoding of the rules that combine knowledge retrieved from Semantic Web sources with semantics in the text.

My current work aims at extending SPARQL in two distinct ways: (i) to allow a better integration of RDF and XML; and (ii) to define a query language for RDF extended with domain specific annotations. Transforming data between XML and RDF is a much required, but not so simple, task in the Semantic Web. The aim of (i) is to enable transparent transformations between these two representation formats, relying on a new query language called XSPARQL. On a different aspect, representing and reasoning with meta-information about RDF triples has been addressed by several proposals for representing time, trust and provenance. A common extension of RDF (and RDFS inferencing rules), capable of encompassing all these proposals, with a clearly defined semantics is much desirable. Building on top of Annotated RDF, we present such an extension and an extension of the SPARQL language capable of querying triples with annotations.

Furthermore, ontology alignment is not an exact science, and concept matchings often involve uncertainty. The goal of this paper is to provide a semantic web repository that supports applying alignments to the dataset and reasoning with alignments. Our goal is to provide high performance queries that return results that include inference across alignment matchings, and rank results using certainty information.

Such approaches are based on either centralized indexing of semantically annotated metadata or link traversal and URI dereferencing as in the case of Linked Open Data. They pose a number of limiting assumptions, thus breaking the openness principle of the Web. In this demo we present a novel technique called Avalanche, designed to allow a data surfer to query the Semantic Web transparently. The technique makes no prior assumptions about data distribution. Specifically, Avalanche can perform \"live\" queries over the Web of Data. First, it gets on-line statistical information about the data distribution, as well as bandwidth availability. Then, it plans and executes the query in a distributed manner trying to quickly provide first answers.", "author": "Cosmin Basca and Abraham Bernstein", "topics": "", "proceedings_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2010/poster-demo-proceedings", "cnt_topic": "0", "cnt_url": "2", "list_url": "http://iswc2010.semanticweb.org/pdf/527.pdf,http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-658/paper527.pdf", "year": "2010", "keywords": "", "list_author": "Cosmin Basca;Abraham Bernstein", "cnt_author": "2", "paper_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2010/poster-demo-proceedings/paper-07", "pages": "", "cnt_keyword": "0", "label_proceedings": "Proceedings of ISWC 2010 Poster and Demo"}, {"category": "Poster/Demo Paper", "link_publisher": "http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-658/paper465.pdf", "link_open_access": "http://iswc2010.semanticweb.org/pdf/465.pdf", "title": "BRAMBLE: A Web-based Framework for Interactive RDF-Graph Visualisation", "subtitle_proceedings": "", "abstract": "Most graph visualisation tools for RDF data are desktop applications focused on loading complete ontologies and metadata from a file and allowing users to filter out information if needed.

The capabilities of the WWW as a medium for collaboration, however, are only starting to be explored. Many historical questions are only answerable by combining information from different sources, from different researchers and organizations. Furthermore, after analyzing original sources, the derived information is often more comprehensive than can be captured by simple keyword indexing. In [3] we report about the application of an adaptive, semantics-based knowledge engineering approach for the development of a prosopographical knowledge base. In this demonstration we will showcase the comprehensive prosopographical knowledge base and its potential for applications. In prosopographical research, historians analyze common characteristics of historical groups by studying statistically relevant quantities of individual biographies. Untraceable periods of biographies can be determined on the basis of such accomplished analyses in combination with statistically examinations as well as patterns of relationships between individuals and their activities. In our case, researchers from the Historical Seminar at the University of Leipzig aimed at creating a prosopographical knowledge base about the life and work of professors in the 600 years history of University of Leipzig ranging from the year 1409 till 2009 - the Catalogus Professorum Lipsiensis (CPL).", "author": "Thomas Riechert,Ulf Morgenstern,S\u00f6ren Auer,Sebastian Tramp and Michael Martin", "topics": "", "proceedings_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2010/poster-demo-proceedings", "cnt_topic": "0", "cnt_url": "2", "list_url": "http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-658/paper532.pdf,http://iswc2010.semanticweb.org/pdf/532.pdf", "year": "2010", "keywords": "", "list_author": "S\u00f6ren Auer;Ulf Morgenstern;Michael Martin;Sebastian Tramp;Thomas Riechert", "cnt_author": "5", "paper_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2010/poster-demo-proceedings/paper-42", "pages": "", "cnt_keyword": "0", "label_proceedings": "Proceedings of ISWC 2010 Poster and Demo"}, {"category": "Poster/Demo Paper", "link_publisher": "http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-658/paper521.pdf", "link_open_access": "http://iswc2010.semanticweb.org/pdf/521.pdf", "title": "The Polish interface for Linked Open Data", "subtitle_proceedings": "", "abstract": "This paper describes an application which aims at producing Polish descriptions for the data available as Linked Open Data, the MusicBrainz knowledge base contents in particular.", "author": "Aleksander Pohl", "topics": "", "proceedings_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2010/poster-demo-proceedings", "cnt_topic": "0", "cnt_url": "2", "list_url": "http://iswc2010.semanticweb.org/pdf/521.pdf,http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-658/paper521.pdf", "year": "2010", "keywords": "", "list_author": "Aleksander Pohl", "cnt_author": "1", "paper_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc/2010/poster-demo-proceedings/paper-44", "pages": "", "cnt_keyword": "0", "label_proceedings": "Proceedings of ISWC 2010 Poster and Demo"}, {"category": "Poster/Demo Paper", "link_publisher": "http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-658/paper488.pdf", "link_open_access": "http://iswc2010.semanticweb.org/pdf/488.pdf", "title": "The eCloudManager Intelligence Edition - Semantic Technologies for Enterprise Cloud Management", "subtitle_proceedings": "", "abstract": "Enterprise clouds apply the paradigm of cloud computing to enterprise IT infrastructures, with the goal of providing easy, flexible, and scalable access to both computing resources and IT services.

Formal languages are used to annotate such data in order to make it machine-understandable; i.e., allow machines to reason about it, to check consistency, to answer queries, or to infer new facts. Essential for this are formalisms that allow for tractable and efficient reasoning algorithms. Particular care is demanded in efficiently responding to the trade-off between expressivity and usefulness. The updated Web Ontology Language (OWL 2) provides dialects that are restricted in their semantic expressivity for optimizing the reasoning behavior; e.g., the OWL 2 EL or OWL 2 RL profiles. Such dialects are very important to respond to the aforementioned trade-off. Profiles reflect particular requirements and yield purposeful balance between expressivity and computational complexity. The support for dialects is not only given in OWL 2, but also in the Rule Interchange Format (RIF) standards. RIF specifies formalisms for the knowl- edge exchange between different rule systems. The same applies for the WSML language that provides variants for Description Logics and rule-based reasoning. The goal remains the same, formalisms that are expressive enough to be useful, while exhibiting reasoning characteristics that can scale to the size of the Web.
