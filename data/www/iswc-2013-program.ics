DESCRIPTION:chair: Willem Robert Van Hage\,Marieke Van Erp\,Pierre van de 
 Laar\,Raphaël Troncy\,Laura Hollink\,David A. Shamma\,Lianli 
 Gao\nabstract: Events are at the heart of many of our daily information 
 sources\, being microposts\, newswire\, calendar information or sensor 
 data. For detecting\, representing and exploiting events in these 
 sources\, different research communities are each trying to resolve a 
 small part of this puzzle. The goal of this workshop is to bring together 
 those different areas in the recent surge of research on the use of 
 events as a key concept for representing and organising knowledge on the 
 Web. The workshop invites contributions to two central questions and its 
 goal is to formulate answers to these questions that advance and reflect 
 the current state of understanding and application of events. Each 
 submission will be expected to address at least one question explicitly\, 
 if possible including a system demonstration. This year\, we have also 
 made available a challenge dataset based on sensor data and we 
 specifically invite contributions that link events in sensor data such as 
 social web and multimedia data using semantic web technologies. The most 
 substantial contributions to the workshop will be presented orally (and 
 if possible with a demo) in sessions organised according to the questions 
 addressed\, with time allocated for deep discussion.\n -DeRiVE 2013

DESCRIPTION:chair: Kerry Taylor\npresenter: Jane Hunter\nabstract: This 
 keynote will describe a number of projects being undertaken at the 
 University of Queensland eResearch Lab that are pushing Semantic Web 
 technologies to their limit to help solve grand challenges in the 
 environmental\, cultural and medical domains. In each of these use 
 cases\, we are integrating multi-modal data streams across space\, time\, 
 disciplines\, formats and agencies to infer and expose new knowledge 
 through rich multi-layered and interactive visualizations. We are 
 developing hypothesis-based query interfaces that provide evidence to 
 validate or refute hypotheses and decision support services that 
 recommend the optimum actions given current or predicted scenarios. We 
 are using ontologies to influence and adapt government policies by 
 linking policy-driven implementations\, investments and management 
 actions to real world indicators. Through evaluation of the methods and 
 assessment of the achievements associated with the OzTrack\, eReef\, 
 Skeletome and Twentieth Century in Paint projects\, I will highlight 
 those Semantic Web technologies that have worked for us and our user 
 communities\, those that haven't and those that need improvement. 
 Finally\, I will discuss what I believe will be the major outstanding 
 research challenges facing Semantic Big Data in the next 5 years and 
 those research areas with the greatest potential for impact.

DESCRIPTION:presenter: Peter Chapman\,John Howse\,Jim Burton\,Gem 
 Stapleton\,Aidan Delaney\nabstract: Ontology engineering has acknowledged 
 benefits yet the notations with which one can create such models can 
 require considerable technical expertise. There has been interest in the 
 development of visual (i.e. diagrammatic) notations that are more readily 
 accessible to those without substantial mathematical training. This 
 tutorial will demonstrate a formal visual logic\, called concept 
 diagrams\, suitable for ontology engineering. The notation has been 
 designed with regard to cognitive theories combined with an emphasis on 
 being sufficiently expressive to model rich domains. The tutorial 
 introduces concept diagrams and attendees will gain knowledge of how to 
 apply concept diagrams for ontology engineering.\n -Modelling Ontologies

DESCRIPTION:chair: Valentina Presutti\,Michael Gruninger\,Laurent 
 Lefort\,Ansgar Scherp\nabstract: This is the fourth edition in a series 
 of workshops addressing the topic of ontology and semantic web patterns 
 as best practices\, related to the ontologydesignpatterns.org initiative. 
 Patterns need to be shared by a community in order to provide a common 
 language\, and to stimulate pattern usage and development. Hence\, the 
 aim of this workshop is twofold: 1) providing an arena for proposing and

DESCRIPTION:presenter: Oscar Corcho\,Jeff Z. Pan\,Jean-Paul 
 Calbimonte\,Emanuele Della Valle\nabstract: The tutorial provides a 
 comprehensive view of the Stream Reasoning research area. It consists of 
 two parts. The first one is focused on RDF and SPARQL extensions for 
 stream processing. It will begin with an introduction to RDF Stream 
 processing models\, and two concrete approaches that implement these 
 models\, namely C-SPARQL Engine and SPARQLStream\, including hands on 
 sessions. The second part of the tutorial explores Stream Reasoning 
 approaches: approximate stream reasoning techniques for OWL2-DL\, 
 incremental materialization for RDF Streams (IMaRS)\, and an overview of 
 EP-SPARQL and Sparkwave. Also the second part includes hands-on 
 sessions.\n -Stream Reasoning for Linked Data Session 1 (09:00-10:30)\n

 Lehmann\,Elena Simperl\,Abraham Bernstein\nabstract: This interactive 
 workshop takes stock of the emergent work and chart the research agenda 
 with interactive sessions to brainstorm ideas and potential applications 
 of collective intelligence to solving AI hard semantic web problems. The 
 Global Brain Semantic Web—a Semantic Web interleaving a large number of 
 human and machine computation—has great potential to overcome some of 
 the issues of the current Semantic Web. In particular\, semantic 
 technologies have been deployed in the context of a wide range of 
 information management tasks in scenarios that are increasingly 
 significant in both technical (data size\, variety and complexity of data 
 sources) and economical terms (industries addressed and their market 
 volume). For many of these tasks\, machine-driven algorithmic techniques 
 aiming at full automation do not reach a level of accuracy that many 
 production environments require. Enhancing automatic techniques with 
 human computation capabilities is becoming a viable solution in many 
 cases. We believe that there is huge potential at the intersection of 
 these disciplines - large scale\, knowledge-driven\, information 
 management and crowdsourcing - to solve technically challenging problems 
 purposefully and in a cost effective manner.\n -CrowdSem Session 1 (09:

DESCRIPTION:chair: Stefan Decker\,Sabrina Kirrane\,Jim Hendler\nabstract: 
 We (the Semantic Web community) are responsible for the conception of 
 technologies that enable large scale integration and mining of personal 
 and public information in all domains of society. This brings 
 unprecedented advantages\, assists humans\, organisations and systems 
 with problem solving\, enables innovation and increases productivity. It 
 makes everything more transparent. However this transparency comes at a 
 price: the loss of our privacy. There has been growing awareness within 
 the community of the need to address privacy and security concerns. To 
 date the focus has been on researching specific privacy and security 
 models and frameworks\, for example for access control\, obfuscation\, 
 anonymization\, aggregation\, licensing\, etc. However we are “putting 
 the cart before the horse”\, we need to identify clear privacy and 
 security requirements before proposing technical solutions. With this 
 workshop we aim at the following goals: First\, raise awareness that the 
 technologies the community are working on have global societal 
 consequences. Vice versa\, our research can be guided by determining a 
 road map for desirable privacy goals. We aim to determine first steps 
 towards identifying desirable goals. Second\, raise awareness of 
 interconnections between the different communities that are involved in 
 Web privacy and security ­ e.g.\, policy makers\, users\, social 
 sciences and computer scientists and provide a platform for 
 interconnection and communication. Third\, determine the next steps that 
 need to be conducted in order to broaden the level of engagement between 
 the relevant parties.\n -PRIVON 2013 Session 1 (09:00-10:30)\n -PRIVON

 Historical and spatial big data from the environmental and agricultural 
 domains already exist in the modern technology-driven world. Government 
 agencies\, utilities and research bodies already have large amounts of 
 data\, but their value is not being fully realised because they are not 
 integrated and consequently big knowledge is difficult to access. 
 Semantic web\, semantic machine learning and linked open data technology 
 may help to build an \"outer knowledge layer\" so that this information 
 could be accessed by domain people and the broader community. It can also 
 be used to answer complex dynamic queries at run time from the system 
 point of view.\n -SML2OD 2013 Session 1 (13:45-15:30)\n -SML2OD 2013

DESCRIPTION:chair: Ziqi Zhang\,Heiko Paulheim\,Claudia D'Amato\,Anna Lisa 
 Gentile\nabstract: This workshop focuses on the exploitation of Linked 
 Data for Web Scale Information Extraction (IE)\, which concerns 
 extracting structured knowledge from unstructured/semi-structured 
 documents on the Web. One of the major bottlenecks for the current state 
 of the art in IE is the availability of learning materials (e.g.\, seed 
 data\, training corpora)\, which\, typically are manually created and are 
 expensive to build and maintain. Linked Data (LD) defines best practices 
 for exposing\, sharing\, and connecting data\, information\, and 
 knowledge on the Semantic Web using uniform means such as URIs and RDF. 
 It has so far been created a gigantic knowledge source of Linked Open 
 Data (LOD)\, which constitutes a mine of learning materials for IE. 
 However\, the massive quantity requires efficient learning algorithms and 
 the unguaranteed quality of data requires robust methods to handle 
 redundancy and noise.LD4IE intends to gather researchers and 
 practitioners to address multiple challenges arising from the usage of LD 
 as learning material for IE tasks\, focusing on (i) modelling user 
 defined extraction tasks using LD\; (ii) gathering learning materials 
 from LD assuring quality (training data selection\, cleaning\, feature 
 selection etc.)\; (iii) robust learning algorithms for handling LD\; (iv) 
 publishing IE results to the LOD cloud.\n -LD4IE Session 1 (09:00-10:

 improvement. Their development and deployment shows the steady maturing 
 of semantic technologies and demonstrates their value in solving current 
 and emerging problems. Examples include enabling generic clients\, 
 facilitating autonomous agents and large scale distributed data 
 integration. Despite the encouraging figures\, the number of enterprises 
 working on and with these technologies is dwarfed by the large number who 
 have not yet adopted semantic technologies. Current adoption is mainly 
 restricted to methodologies provided by the research community. Although 
 Semantic Web acts as candidate technology to the industry\, it does not 
 win through in current enterprise challenges like data fusion\, data 
 integration or natural language processing (e.g. IBM Watson). To better 
 understand the market dynamics uptake needs to be addressed and if

DESCRIPTION:chair: Pascal Hitzler\npresenter: Peter Fox\nabstract: As 
 collaborative\, or network science spreads into more science\, 
 engineering and medical fields\, both the participants and their funders 
 have expressed a very strong desire for highly functional data and 
 information capabilities that are a) easy to use\, b) integrated in a 
 variety of ways\, c) leverage prior investments and keep pace with rapid 
 technical change\, and d) are not expensive or time-consuming to build or 
 maintain. In response\, and based on our accumulated experience over the 
 last decade and a maturing of several key semantic web approaches\, we 
 have adapted\, extended\, and integrated several open source applications 
 and frameworks that handle major portions of functionality for these 
 platforms. At minimum\, these functions include: an object-type 
 repository\, collaboration tools\, an ability to identify and manage all 
 key entities in the platform\, and an integrated portal to manage diverse 
 content and applications\, with varied access levels and privacy options. 
 At the same time\, there is increasing attention to how researchers 
 present and explain results based on interpretation of increasingly 
 diverse and heterogeneous data and information sources. With the renewed 
 emphasis on good data practices\, informatics practitioners have 
 responded to this challenge with maturing informatics-based approaches. 
 These approaches include\, but are not limited to\, use case development\;
  information modeling and architectures\; elaborating vocabularies\; 
 mediating interfaces to data and related services on the Web\; and 
 traceable provenance. The current era of data-intensive research presents 
 numerous challenges to both individuals and research teams. In 
 environmental science especially\, sub-fields that were data-poor are 
 becoming data-rich (volume\, type and mode)\, while some that were 
 largely model/ simulation driven are now dramatically shifting to 
 data-driven or least to data-model assimilation approaches. These 
 paradigm shifts make it very hard for researchers used to one mode to 
 shift to another\, let alone produce products of their work that are 
 usable or understandable by non-specialists. However\, it is exactly at 
 these frontiers where much of the exciting environmental science needs to 
 be performed and appreciated. XVIII Research networks (even small ones) 
 need to deal with people\, and many intellectual artifacts produced or 
 consumed in research\, organizational and/our outreach activities\, as 
 well as the relations among them. Increasingly these networks are modeled 
 as knowledge networks\, i.e. graphs with named and typed relations among 
 the 'nodes'. Some important nodes are: people\, organizations\, 
 datasets\, events\, presentations\, publications\, videos\, meetings\, 
 reports\, groups\, and more. In this heterogeneous ecosystem\, it is 
 important to use a set of common informatics approaches to co-design and 
 co-evolve the needed science data platforms based on what real people 
 want to use them for. We present our methods and results for information 
 modeling\, adapting\, integrating and evolving a networked data science 
 and information architecture based on several open source technologies 
 (e.g. Drupal\, VIVO\, the Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network\; 
 CKAN\, and the Global Handle System\; GHS) and many semantic 
 technologies. We discuss the results in the context of the Deep Carbon 
 Virtual Observatory and the Global Change Information System\, and 
 conclude with musings on how the smart mediation among the components is 
 modeled and managed\, and its general applicability and ecacy.

DESCRIPTION:chair: Stefan Schlobach\,Markus Krötzsch\,Irene 
 Celino\,Emanuele Della Valle\nabstract: More and more applications 
 require real-time processing of massive\, dynamically generated\, ordered 
 data\; where order is often an essential factor reflecting recency\, 
 proximity or relevance. Stream and rank-aware data management techniques 
 are progressively providing reactive and reliable query answering over 
 such massive datasets\, allowing integration of highly dynamic sources. 
 Key to their success is the use of streaming algorithms that harness the 
 natural or enforceable orders in the data. The expressive power of 
 Semantic technologies is needed in those applications\, but Semantic 
 Technologies risk being unable to address the needs of those 
 applications\, because they do not consider ordering as an essential 
 property. Ranking results is often seen as an “added task”\, 
 performed after inference\, without affecting the inference process\, 
 which is order-agnostic. However\, we perceive a trend towards 
 order-aware semantic technologies: both researchers and practitioners 
 understand that order matters in reasoning over massive and highly 
 dynamic data. The idea of Stream Reasoning is gaining considerable 
 momentum. Some top-k query answering techniques for Linked Data appeared. 
 Several works are considering SPARQL query answering on RDF annotated 
 with labels partially ordered. The Description Logic community is 
 investigating top-k ontological query answering. This workshop aims at 
 bringing together this growing and very active community interested in 
 integrating ordering with reasoning by using methods inspired by stream 
 and rank-aware data management. We see this workshop as a first step to 
 stimulate and guide a paradigm shift in semantic technologies.\n -OrdRing

DESCRIPTION:chair: Payam Barnaghi\,Oscar Corcho\,Manfred Hauswirth\,Kerry 
 Taylor\,Cory Henson\,Amit Sheth\nabstract: It is estimated that today 
 there are 4 billion mobile devices that can act as sensors\, including 
 active and passive RFID tags. This is complemented by an even larger 
 number of fixed sensors recording observations of a wide variety of 
 modalities. Geographically distributed sensor nodes are capable of 
 forming ad hoc networking topologies\, with nodes expected to be 
 dynamically inserted and removed from a network. The sensors are 
 increasingly being connected with Web infrastructure\, and the Sensor Web 
 Enablement (SWE) standard developed by the Open Geospatial Consortium is 
 widely being adopted in industry\, government and academia alike. While 
 such frameworks provide some interoperability\, semantics is increasingly 
 seen as key enabler for integration of sensor data and broader Web 
 information systems. Analytical and reasoning capabilities afforded by 
 Semantic Web standards and technologies are considered important for 
 developing advanced applications that go from capturing observations to 
 recognition of events and ultimately developing comprehensive situational 
 awareness. Defense\, transportation\, global enterprise\, and natural 
 resource management industries are leading the rapid emergence of 
 applications in commercial\, civic\, and scientific operations that 
 involve sensors\, web\, services and semantics. Semantic technologies are 
 often proposed as important components of complex\, 
 cross-jurisdictional\, heterogeneous\, dynamic information systems. The 
 needs and opportunities arising from the rapidly growing capabilities of 
 networked sensing devices are a challenging case.\n -SSN 2013 Session 1

 Cotton\,Armin Haller\,Alistair Hamilton\nabstract: The goal of this 
 workshop is to explore and strengthen the relationship between the 
 Semantic Web and statistical communities\, to provide better access to 
 the data held by statistical offices. It will focus on ways in which 
 statisticians can use Semantic Web technologies and standards in order to 
 formalize\, publish\, document and link their data and metadata. The 
 workshop will also cover the question of how to apply statistical methods 
 or treatments to linked data\, and how to develop new methods and tools 
 for this purpose. Except for visualisation techniques and tools\, this 
 question is relatively unexplored\, but the subject will obviously grow 
 in importance in the near future.\n -SemStats 2013 Session 1 (09:00-10:

 Simperl\nabstract: Microtask crowdsourcing platforms\, as one of the most 
 popular instance of social computing technologies\, are increasingly used 
 to support massively collaborative projects on semantic content 
 management. In this tutorial we will introduce the most popular 
 approaches to microtask crowdsourcing for Semantic Web problems\, as a 
 mean to realize hybrid human-machine content management architectures. We 
 will explain the core notions and technologies\, including Amazon 
 Mechanical Turk\, CrowdFlower and specifically purposed tools building 
 upon the functionality of these platforms. We will address questions 
 related to quality assurance\, resource management\, and workflow 
 design\, and discuss a series of technical and socio-economical 
 challenges and open issues related to the application of microtask 
 crowdsourcing in given Semantic Web scenarios.\n -Microtask tutorial

DESCRIPTION:chair: Chris Welty\npresenter: Ramanathan V. Guha\nabstract: 
 A significant fraction of the pages on the web are generated from 
 structured databases. A longstanding goal of the semantic web initiative 
 is to get webmasters to make this structured data directly available on 
 the web. The path towards this objective has been rocky at best. While 
 there have been some notable wins (such as RSS and FOAF)\, many of the 
 other initiatives have seen little industry adoption. Learning from these 
 earlier attempts has guided the development of schema.org\, which appears 
 to have altered the trajectory. Two years after its launch over 4 million 
 Internet domains are are using schema.org markup. In this talk\, we 
 recount the history behind the early efforts and try to understand why 
 some of them succeeded while others failed. We will then give an update 
 on Schema.org\, its goals\, accomplishments and where it is headed. We 
 will also discuss some of the interesting research problems being 
 addressed in the context of this effort.

 Norton\nabstract: In one study it was reported that there is 500 times as 
 much data in the hidden or deep web\, then there is in crawlable\, 
 indexable web pages. Most of this data is stored in relational databases. 
 Hence\, the Semantic Web’s promise of Web-scale data integration will 
 only live up to its true promise with the inclusion of legacy relational 
 database management systems (RDBMS). Two new\, interrelated and 
 complementary W3C standards\, “Direct Mapping of Relational Data to 
 RDF” and “R2RML: RDB to RDF Mapping Language”\, are poised to 
 enable this data into the web of Linked Data. This tutorial will 
 introduce\, contrast and explain the preferred solution organizations 
 embodies by these two standards. The tutorial will also include a 
 hands-on session.\n -Relational Database to RDF Session 1 (09:00-10:30)\n

 Nickles\nabstract: This Workshop is an exciting opportunity for 
 collaboration and cross-fertilization between the uncertainty reasoning 
 community and the Semantic Web community. Effective methods for reasoning 
 under uncertainty are vital for realizing many aspects of the Semantic 
 Web vision\, but the ability of current-generation web technology to 
 handle uncertainty remains extremely limited. Thus\, there is a 
 continuing demand for uncertainty reasoning technology among Semantic Web 
 researchers and developers\, and the URSW workshop creates a unique 
 opening to bring together two communities with a clear commonality of 
 interest but limited history of interaction. By capitalizing on this 
 opportunity\, URSW could spark dramatic progress toward realizing the 
 Semantic Web vision.\n -URSW 2013 Session 1 (13:45-15:30)\n -URSW 2013

 Hogan\nabstract: The quantity of published Linked Data continues to 
 increase. However\, applications that exploit Linked Data are not yet 
 widespread. Reasons may include a lack of suitable solutions for a number 
 of open problems. The diversity and dynamics of LOD sources have brought 
 new challenges in seamless data integration\, dynamic discovery\, 
 provenance tracking\, and quality assessment at the Web scale. Addressing 
 these issues requires joint community efforts from both LOD provision and 
 consumption perspectives\, including the development and investigation of 
 concepts that can lead towards the realisation of a sustainable Linked 
 Data ecosystem. The objective of this workshop is to provide a focused 
 venue for academic and industrial discussions on concepts\, algorithms\, 
 infrastructure and tools (including systematic analysis and rigorous 
 evaluation) that help to exploit Linked Data (and not just to produce 
 it).\n -COLD 2013 Session 1 (09:00-10:30)\n -COLD 2013 Session 2 (11:

 Euzenat\,Ernesto Jiménez-Ruiz\nabstract: Ontology matching is a key 
 interoperability enabler for the Semantic Web\, as well as a useful 
 tactic in some classical data integration tasks dealing with the semantic 
 heterogeneity problem. It takes the ontologies as input and determines as 
 output an alignment\, that is\, a set of correspondences between the 
 semantically related entities of those ontologies. These correspondences 
 can be used for various tasks\, such as ontology merging\, data 
 translation\, query answering or navigation on the web of data. Thus\, 
 matching ontologies enables the knowledge and data expressed in the 
 matched ontologies to interoperate.\n -OM-2013 Session 1 (09:15-10:45)\n

DESCRIPTION:chair: Sebastian Hellmann\,Pablo Mendes\,Dimitris 
 Kontokostas\,Caroline Barrière\,Agata Filipowska\nabstract: Recently\, 
 the DBpedia community has experienced an immense increase in activity and 
 we believe\, that the time has come to explore the connection between 
 DBpedia & Natural Language Processing (NLP) in a yet unpreceded depth. 
 The goal of this workshop can be summarized by this (pseudo-) formula: 
 DBpedia & NLP ≡ DBpedia4NLP ⨅ NLP4DBpedia. DBpedia has a 
 long-standing tradition to provide useful data as well as a commitment to 
 reliable Semantic Web technologies and living best practices. With the 
 rise of WikiData\, DBpedia is step-by-step relieved from the tedious 
 extraction of data from Wikipedia’s infoboxes and can shift its focus 
 on new challenges such as extracting information from the unstructured 
 article text as well as becoming a testing ground for multilingual NLP 
 methods.\n -Dbpedia & NLP 2013 Session 1 (09:00-10:30)\n -DBpedia & NLP

DESCRIPTION:presenter: Ziqi Zhang\,Anna Lisa Gentile\nabstract: This 
 tutorial analyses open challenges for Web-scale Information Extraction 
 (IE) and introduces the usage of Linked Data (LD) for the task. Linked 
 Data has grown to a gigantic knowledge base\, which\, as of 2013\, 
 comprised 31 billion triples in 295 datasets (http:
 //lod-cloud.net/state/). Such resources can become invaluable resources 
 to train Web-scale IE and natural language tasks because they are very 
 large scale and covering multiple domains. This tutorial will show how to 
 exploit LD for IE and will explore IE techniques able to scale at web 
 level. We will particularly focus on the tasks of Wrapper Induction and 
 Table Interpretation.\n -Linked Data for Web Scale Information Extraction
