Proceedings", "abstract": "The World Wide Web (WWW) now is widely used as a universal medium for information exchange. Semantic interoperability among different information systems in the WWW is limited due to information heterogeneity problem. Ontologies have been suggested as a way to solve this problem. Given that no universal ontology exists for the WWW, work has focused on finding semantic correspondences between similar elements of different ontologies, i.e., ontology mapping. Ontology mapping can be done either by hand or using automated tools. Manual mapping becomes impractical as the size and complexity of ontologies increases. Fully or semi-automated mapping approaches have been examined by different research studies, e.g., analyzing linguistic information of elements in ontologies, treating ontologies as structural graphs, applying heuristic rules to look for specific mapping patterns and machine learning techniques. This paper proposes a new generic and scalable ontology mapping approach, which takes advantage of propagation theory, information retrieval technique and artificial intelligence model to solve ontology mapping problem. The major procedures of the proposed approach are profile enrichment, profile propagation, IR-based profile mapping and the interactive activation network based constraints satisfaction. The profile enrichment builds a profile for each element in the ontologies, and thus enriches its information. The profile propagation exploits the neighboring information of each element by passing the profile of the ancestors, descendants or siblings of the element to the profile of itself, with different weights. The IR-based profile mapping process compares the cosine similarity of elements\u00e2\u0080\u0099 profiles in a vector space model. Finally the interactive activation network is integrated to deal with the constraints satisfaction problems in the context of ontology mapping.", "author": "Ming Mao", "topics": "", "proceedings_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc-aswc/2007/proceedings", "cnt_topic": "0", "cnt_url": "2", "list_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-76298-0_72,http://iswc2007.semanticweb.org/papers/925.pdf", "year": "2007", "keywords": "", "list_author": "Ming Mao", "cnt_author": "1", "paper_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc-aswc/2007/proceedings/paper-54", "pages": "931-935", "cnt_keyword": "0", "label_proceedings": "The Semantic Web"}, {"category": "Doctoral Consortium Paper", "link_publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-76298-0_71", "link_open_access": "http://iswc2007.semanticweb.org/papers/920.pdf", "title": "Ontology-Driven Management of Semantic Spaces", "subtitle_proceedings": "6th International Semantic Web Conference, 2nd Asian Semantic Web Conference, ISWC 2007 + ASWC 2007, Busan, Korea, November 11-15, 2007.

Proceedings", "abstract": "In different areas ontologies have been developed and many of these ontologies contain overlapping information. Often we would therefore want to be able to use multiple ontologies. To obtain good results, we need to find the relationships between terms in the different ontologies, i.e. we need to align them. Currently, there already exist a number of different alignment strategies. However, it is usually difficult for a user that needs to align two ontologies to decide which of the different available strategies are the most suitable. In this paper we propose a method that provides recommendations on alignment strategies for a given alignment problem.

In this paper we present AllRight, a comprehensive ontology instantiating system. In particular, the techniques implemented in AllRight are designed for application scenarios, in which the desired instance information is given in the form of tables and for which existing Information Extraction approaches based on statistical or natural language processing methods are not directly applicable. Within AllRight, we have therefore developed new techniques for dealing with tabular instance data and combined these techniques with existing methods. The system supports all necessary steps for ontology instantiation, i.e. web crawling, name extraction, document clustering as well as fact extraction and validation. AllRight has been successfully evaluated in the popular domains of digital cameras and notebooks leading to a about eighty percent accuracy of the extracted facts given only a very limited amount of seed knowledge.", "author": "Kostyantyn M.

Recently, social annotation services have become more and more popular in Semantic Web. It allows users to arbitrarily annotate web resources, thus, largely lowers the barrier to cooperation. Furthermore, through providing abundant meta-data resources, social annotation might become a key to the development of Semantic Web. However, on the other hand, social annotation has its own apparent limitations, for instance, 1) ambiguity and synonym phenomena and 2) lack of hierarchical information. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised model to automatically derive hierarchical semantics from social annotations. Using a social bookmark service Del.icio.us as example, we demonstrate that the derived hierarchical semantics has the ability to compensate those shortcomings.

Even when the data access and processing operations are implemented as web or grid services, workflows are often constructed manually in languages such as BPEL.  Adding semantic descriptions of the services enables automatic or mixed-initiative composition. In most previous work, these descriptions consists of semantic types for inputs and outputs of services or a type for the service as a whole. While this is certainly useful, we argue that is not enough to model and construct complex data workflows. We present a planning approach to automatically constructing data processing workflows where the inputs and outputs of services are relational descriptions in an expressive logic. Our workflow planner uses relational subsumption to connect the output of a service with the input of another.

It exploits simple mappings based on virtual documents, and eliminates incorrect mappings via validating mapping consistency. Additionally, it also constructs a special type of semantic mappings, called contextual mappings, which is useful for practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs well on several data sets from real world domains.", "author": "Wei Hu, Yuzhong Qu", "topics": "", "proceedings_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc-aswc/2007/proceedings", "cnt_topic": "0", "cnt_url": "2", "list_url": "http://iswc2007.semanticweb.org/papers/225.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-76298-0_17", "year": "2007", "keywords": "", "list_author": "Wei Hu;Yuzhong Qu", "cnt_author": "2", "paper_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc-aswc/2007/proceedings/paper-24", "pages": "225-238", "cnt_keyword": "0", "label_proceedings": "The Semantic Web"}, {"category": "Research Track Paper", "link_publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-76298-0_1", "link_open_access": "http://iswc2007.semanticweb.org/papers/001.pdf", "title": "Enabling Advanced and Context-Dependent Access Control in RDF Stores", "subtitle_proceedings": "6th International Semantic Web Conference, 2nd Asian Semantic Web Conference, ISWC 2007 + ASWC 2007, Busan, Korea, November 11-15, 2007.

In general, these proposals reduce the autonomy of each ontology by defining the semantics of the ontology to depend on the semantics of the other ontologies. We propose a new framework for managing autonomy in a set of cooperating ontologies (or ontology space). In this framework, each language entity (concept/role/individual) in an ontology may have its meaning assigned either locally with respect to the semantics of its own ontology, to preserve the autonomy of the ontology, or globally with respect to the semantics of any neighbouring ontology in which it is defined, thus enabling semantic cooperation between multiple ontologies. In this way, each ontology has a \"subjective semantics\" based on local interpretation and a \"foreign semantics\" based on semantic binding to neighbouring ontologies.  We study the properties of these two semantics and describe the conditions under which entailment and satisfiability are preserved.  We also introduce two reasoning mechanisms under this framework: \"cautious reasoning\" and \"brave reasoning\". Cautious reasoning is done with respect to a local ontology and its neighbours (those ontologies in which its entities are defined); brave reasoning is done with respect to the transitive closure of this relationship. This framework is independent of ontology languages.

In addition, due to the huge volume of information on the Semantic Web, the hybrid query must be processed in a very scalable way. In this paper, we define such a hybrid query capability that combines unary tree-shaped structured queries with keyword searches. We show how existing information retrieval (IR) index structures and functions can be reused to index semantic web data and its textual information, and how the hybrid query is evaluated on the index structure using IR engines in an efficient and scalable manner. We implemented this IR approach in an engine called Semplore. Comprehensive experiments on its performance show that it is a promising approach.

Thus, this paper develops an algorithm, namely combiSQORE to determine whether the available collection of ontologies is able to completely satisfy a submitted query and return a single or combinative ontology that guarantees query coverage.

We have enriched the knowledge base by means of text mining techniques, in order to discover on-topic relations. Several reasoning techniques have been applied, in order to infer relevant implicit relationships. Finally, the ontology and the knowledge base have been deployed on a semantic wiki by means of the WikiFactory tool, which allows users to browse the ontology and the knowledge base, to introduce new relations, to revise wrong assertions in a collaborative way, and to perform semantic queries. In our experiments, we have been able to easily implement several functionalities, such as expert finding, by simply formulating ad-hoc queries from either an ontology editor or the semantic wiki interface.

Text categorization is the task of classifying text documents under predened categories. Accidentology is our application eld and the goal of our framework is to classify documents describing real road accidents under predened road accident prototpypes, which also are described by text documents. Accidents are described by accident reports while accident prototypes are described by accident scenarios. Thus, text categorization is done by assigning each accident report to an accident scenario, which highlights particular mechanisms leading to accident. We propose a textual case based reasoning approach (TCBR), which allows us to integrate both textual and domain knowledge aspects inorder to carry out this categorization. CBR solves a new problem (target case) by identifying its similarity to one or several previously solved problems (source cases) stored in a case base and by adapting their known solutions. Cases of our framework are created from text. Most of TCBR applications create cases from text by using Information Retrieval techniques, which leads to knowledge-poor descriptions of cases. We show that using semantic resources (two ontology of accidentology) makes possible to overcome this diculty, and allows us to enrich cases by using formal knowledge. In this paper, we argue that semantic resources are likely to improve the quality of cases created from text, and, therefore, such resources can support the reasoning cycle. We illustrate this claim with our framework developed to classify documents in the accidentology domain.", "author": "Valentina Ceausu, Sylvie Despr\u00e8s", "topics": "", "proceedings_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc-aswc/2007/proceedings", "cnt_topic": "0", "cnt_url": "2", "list_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-76298-0_53,http://iswc2007.semanticweb.org/papers/729.pdf", "year": "2007", "keywords": "", "list_author": "Valentina Ceausu;Sylvie Despr\u00e8s", "cnt_author": "2", "paper_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc-aswc/2007/proceedings/paper-12", "pages": "736-749", "cnt_keyword": "0", "label_proceedings": "The Semantic Web"}, {"category": "Semantic Web In Use Track Paper", "link_publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-76298-0_60", "link_open_access": "http://iswc2007.semanticweb.org/papers/823.pdf", "title": "Application of Ontology Translation", "subtitle_proceedings": "6th International Semantic Web Conference, 2nd Asian Semantic Web Conference, ISWC 2007 + ASWC 2007, Busan, Korea, November 11-15, 2007.

Proceedings", "abstract": "Data warehouse is now widely used in business analysis and decision making processes. To adapt the rapidly changing business environment, we develop a tool to make data warehouses more business-friendly by using Semantic Web technologies. The main idea is to make business semantics explicit by uniformly representing the business metadata (i.e. conceptual enterprise data model and multidimensional model) with an extended OWL language. Then a mapping from the business metadata to the schema of the data warehouse is built.  When an analysis request is raised, a customized data mart with data populated from the data warehouse can be automatically generated with the help of this built-in knowledge. This tool, called Enterprise Information Asset Workbench (EIAW), is deployed at the Taikang Life Insurance Company, one of the top five insurance companies of China. User feedback shows that OWL provides an excellent basis for the representation of business semantics in data warehouse, but many necessary extensions are also needed in the real application. The user also deemed this tool very helpful because of its flexibility and speeding up data mart deployment in face of business changes.", "author": "Guo Tong Xie, Yang Yang, Shengping Liu, Zhaoming Qiu, Yue Pan, Xiongzhi Zhou", "topics": "", "proceedings_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc-aswc/2007/proceedings", "cnt_topic": "0", "cnt_url": "2", "list_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-76298-0_62,http://iswc2007.semanticweb.org/papers/851.pdf", "year": "2007", "keywords": "", "list_author": "Yang Yang;Zhaoming Qiu;Yue Pan;Xiongzhi Zhou;Shengping Liu;Guo Tong Xie", "cnt_author": "6", "paper_uri": "http://data.semanticweb.org/conference/iswc-aswc/2007/proceedings/paper-25", "pages": "857-870", "cnt_keyword": "0", "label_proceedings": "The Semantic Web"}, {"category": "Semantic Web In Use Track Paper", "link_publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-76298-0_56", "link_open_access": "http://iswc2007.semanticweb.org/papers/771.pdf", "title": "HealthFinland - Finnish Health Information on the Semantic Web", "subtitle_proceedings": "6th International Semantic Web Conference, 2nd Asian Semantic Web Conference, ISWC 2007 + ASWC 2007, Busan, Korea, November 11-15, 2007.

An obstacle to automating such clinical tasks is the need to bridge the semantic gulf between raw patient data, such as laboratory tests or specific medications, and the way a clinician interprets this data. Our key insight is that matching patients to clinical trials can be formulated as a problem of semantic retrieval. We describe the technical challenges to building a realistic case study, which include problems related to scalability, the integration of large ontologies, and dealing with noisy, inconsistent data.

In this paper, we present a Protege plugin which supports the systematic reuse of global identifiers for instances in RDF/OWL knowledge base. The plugin is an extension of the \"individual\" tab. The main difference is that, when an instance is created, the user has a chance of looking for a pre-existing URI for the corresponding individual in a publicly available service called OKKAM. The match between the newly created instance and the stored individuals is based on an algorithm which compares the features of the new isntance with a simple profile stored in OKKAM for all individuals.
