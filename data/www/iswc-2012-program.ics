DESCRIPTION:presenter: Tim Berners-Lee\; John Gianandrea\; Frank van 
 Harmelen\; Mike Stonebreaker\; Bryan Thompson\nabstract: The Semantic Web 
 / Linked Data has grown immensely over the past years. When the Semantic 
 Web community started working over a decade ago the main question was 
 where to get the data from. By now the question of how to process ever 
 increasing amount of semantic/linked data has come to people's utmost 
 attention. The goal of this panel is to shed light on the various 
 approaches/options for Big Graph Data processing. Possible questions 
 include: (1)Does the Semantic Web need any central infrastructures? (It's 
 a Web\, after all?) (2)Or will a handful of large single-owner 
 infrastructures dominate the Semantic Web\, just as they now dominate the 
 current Web? (3)And if so\, will such infrastructures be based on the 
 standard relational model? (4)Or on MapReduce-centric key/value-pairs? 
 (5)Is Google's (centralised) Knowledge Graph anathema to the Semantic 
 *Web* ? (6)Are triplestore vendors just reinventing the old database 
 wheels? (7)What is the role of clustered MapReduce-like solutions and 
 where are their limits for processing semantic web data?

DESCRIPTION:chair: Timothy Lebo\,Paul Groth\,Luc Moreau\,Jun 
 Zhao\nabstract: Provenance (the origin or source) of information is 
 critical in deciding whether information is to be trusted\, how it should 
 be integrated with other diverse information sources\, and how to give 
 credit to its originators when reusing it. In order to promote the 
 widespread publication of provenance information on the Web\, the W3C is 
 producing the W3C PROV set of specifications. These specifications 
 provide a basis for the common exchange of provenance information on the 
 Web. This half- day tutorial provides you with an indepth dive into these 
 specifications including handson information on how to publish\, query 
 and access provenance information. You will learn how to model your 
 provenance data using the PROV data model and ontology\, how to produce 
 provenance information that enables integrity checking and inferences\, 
 as well as how to expose and acquire provenance information using PROV 
 access mechanisms and services.

DESCRIPTION:chair: Volker Tresp\,Maximilian Nickel\nabstract: Machine 
 learning has become increasingly important in the context of Linked Data 
 as it is an enabling technology for many important tasks such as link 
 prediction\, information retrieval or group detection. The fundamental 
 data structure of Linked Data is a graph. Graphs are also ubiquitous in 
 many other fields of application\, such as social networks\, 
 bioinformatics or the World Wide Web. Recently\, tensor factorizations 
 have emerged as a highly promising approach to machine learning on 
 graph-structured data\, showing both scalability and excellent results on 
 benchmark data sets\, while matching perfectly to the triple structure of 
 RDF. This tutorial will provide an introduction to tensor factorizations 
 and their applications for machine learning on graphs. By the means of 
 concrete tasks such as link prediction we will discuss several 
 factorization methods in-depth and also provide necessary theoretical 
 background on tensors in general. Emphasis is put on tensor models that 
 are of interest to Linked Data\, which will include models that are able 
 to factorize large-scale graphs with millions of entities and known facts 
 or models that can handle the open-world assumption of Linked Data. 
 Furthermore\, we will discuss tensor models for temporal and sequential 
 graph data\, e.g. to analyze social networks over time.

DESCRIPTION:chair: Mike Dean\,Michael Kifer\,Benjamin Grosof\nabstract: 
 The area of semantic rules is perhaps the most important frontier today 
 for the Semantic Webs core technology and standards. Recent progress 
 includes major initial industry standards from W3C and OMG\, and 
 fundamental advances in the underlying knowledge representation 
 techniques in declarative logic programs\, including most recently for 
 efficient higher-order defaults with sound integration of first order 
 logic ontologies (OWL). Recent progress also includes methods to use 
 rules for\, or with\, more expressive OWL ontologies\; increasing 
 integration of rules with query /search in SPARQL and relational 
 databases\; substantive translations between heterogeneous types of 
 commercial rule engines\; development of open-source tools for 
 inferencing and interoperability\; performance benchmarking of rule 
 systems\; a wide range of emerging applications including in business\, 
 science\, and trust\; and accelerating industry investments / 
 acquisitions in the technology including by integrated software companies 
 such as Oracle\, IBM\, and Microsoft. This tutorial will provide a 
 comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to these developments and to 
 the fundamentals of the key technologies and outstanding research issues 
 involved. It will explore example application scenarios\, overall 
 requirements and challenges\, and touch upon business /social value and 
 strategy considerations.

DESCRIPTION:abstract: Most of the knowledge available on the Web is 
 encoded in natural language texts or Web documents aimed primarily at 
 human consumption. A promising approach to have programmatic access to 
 such knowledge uses information extraction techniques that aim to extract 
 machine readable structures from free texts\, from which it is possible 
 to retrieve entities and categories. These entities can potentially be 
 linked to each other\, creating de facto a global knowledge graph of 
 linked entities. The WoLE2012 workshop envisions the Web as a Web of 
 Linked Entities (WoLE)\, which transparently connects the World Wide Web 
 (WWW) and the Giant Global Graph (GGG) using methods from Information 
 Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The focus of this 
 workshop is to bring together the Information Retrieval\, Semantic Web 
 and NLP communities. The primary goal is to strengthen research 
 techniques that provide access to textual information published on the 
 Web to further improve the adoption of Semantic Web technology.

DESCRIPTION:chair: Walter Bender\,Victor de Boer\,Stefan 
 Schlobach\,Guéret Christophe\,Bernie Innocenti\nabstract: Linked Data 
 have by-and-large been designed around centralized\, powerful Web servers 
 and the (mobile) clients accessing them. As a direct consequence of these 
 design decisions\, the usage of data- sharing technologies depends on the 
 availability of a Web infrastructure comprised of data-centers\, 
 high-speed\, reliable Internet connections\, and modern client devices. 
 Four-billion people currently have no access to such an infrastructure 
 and are thus deprived of the benefits Linked (Open) Data provides. This 
 tutorial will show how the design principles and technologies of Linked 
 Data can be adapted to distributed networks\, and thus contribute to 
 closing this digital data divide. Join us to learn how not to forget 
 the majority of the world population when thinking of the potential users 
 of Linked Data and discuss the challenges this represents for the 
 research community.

DESCRIPTION:abstract: The Semantic Web\, as a field\, is undergoing a 
 major shift. After 10 years of mainly foundations-driven research\, we 
 now see strong indicators that Semantic Web methods are entering 
 mainstream technology\, in a number of forms. The consequent rise in 
 commercial interest will likely have a fundamental impact on the field. 
 Some established research results will make it into mainstream 
 applications. Others will become obsolete. Radically new ideas will 
 emerge. It is thus the right time for the community to contemplate the 
 way ahead. In this workshop\, we will provide an exciting forum for the 
 discussion of the future of the Semantic Web. Researchers and 
 practitioners from all corners of the field are invited to provide their 
 insights and projections. The event will focus on discussions and the 
 exchange of ideas\, and will use a mix of different styles of interaction 
 between the participants. It is always good to try to look ahead and 
 anticipate the development of a field. For the Semantic Web\, it is now 
 particularly important because recent developments indicate that Semantic 
 Web technologies are entering the industrial mainstream. Schema.org and 
 the Facebook Open Graph Protocol are bringing metadata to bear on the Web 
 large-scale. IBMs Watson and Apples Siri incorporate Semantic 
 Technologies. Google is revamping its search approach and is going more 
 semantic in implementing their knowledge graph. And these are just a few 
 of the prominent examples. The commercial uptake will be a game-changer 
 for the field. It seems that only a fraction of the research results of 
 the past ten years are currently being picked up. It seems that shallow 
 semantics brings added value in many\, but not all\, application areas. 
 In others it seems that there are roadblocks for which deep semantics is 
 required for added value  but current approaches are still limited. 
 Linked Data and Big Data are popular buzzwords right now\, but could they 
 be hitting a peak on the expectation curve? If so\, what is going to

 fields future? In this workshop\, we intend to bring together 
 researchers from all corners of the broader Semantic Web community\, to 
 share and discuss projections of the way ahead in Semantic Web 
 technologies and knowledge engineering in general.

DESCRIPTION:chair: Caroline Barrière\nabstract: In this tutorial\, we 
 will start with the basics of natural language processing (NLP) and will 
 explain different levels of analysis (segmentation\, morphology\, 
 lexicon\, syntax\, semantic). We will then look at the specific tasks 
 involved in mining sentences to extract resource description framework 
 (RDF) triples and show the importance that each level of language 
 analysis can play in such tasks. NLP researchers have been working on 
 such tasks for many years and have developed many algorithms to perform 
 part-of-speech tagging\, parsing\, semantic disambiguation\, named entity 
 recognition and relation extraction. We will present baseline algorithms 
 for these tasks to show expected results from state-of-the-art research. 
 As many algorithms use machine learning (ML) techniques\, we will provide 
 a simple introduction to the aims and general principles behind such 
 techniques and explain why they are so important to the NLP community. We 
 will also explore problems that arise when extracting knowledge from 
 multiple sentences and how that is closely related to concept mapping 
 problems\, which are familiar to the semantic web community. Since fully 
 automatic text mining is quite a difficult task\, we will emphasize that 
 semi-automatic approaches can be effective and viable solutions for 
 facilitating the RDFization of textual data.

DESCRIPTION:abstract: Scientific communication has traditionally relied 
 upon publications and presentations\, with an estimate of millions of 
 publications worldwide per year\; the growth rate of PubMed alone is now 
 1 paper per minute. The results described in these articles are often 
 backed by large amounts of diverse data produced by complex experiments\, 
 computer simulations\, and observations of physical phenomena. Because of 
 this avalanche of data\, it is increasingly hard to validate\, 
 reproduce\, reuse and leverage scientific data. In addition\, although 
 publications\, methods and datasets are very related\, they are not 
 easily accessible and interlinked. The notable exception is omics 
 research where journals require deposit of sequences in databanks as a 
 condition of publication. Even where data is discoverable and 
 accessible\, significant challenges remain in data reuse and sharing\, in 
 facilitating the necessary correlation\, integration and synthesis of 
 data across levels of theory\, techniques and disciplines. In the 2nd 
 International Workshop on Linked Science (LISC2012) we will discuss and 
 present results of new ways of publishing\, sharing and linking 
 scientific data together\, and reasoning over such data to discover 
 interesting new links to validate research. The theme of this years 
 workshop will focus on research addressing these issues with respect to 
 big data. Big Data is loosely characterized by the size and/or number of 
 individual files\, the number of represented variables\, a range of 
 physical scales\, a range of scientific disciplines\, heterogeneous 
 metadata and data formats\, in short data that cannot easily be accessed 
 and manipulated from a thumb-drive.

DESCRIPTION:abstract: One part of this workshop (LHD) is designed to 
 bring together people from different fields working in the area of 
 dynamic matching\, interpretation\, and integration of heterogeneous 
 data\, so that ideas\, techniques and problems can be shared and 
 discussed in a broad context. A key part of this workshop is bringing 
 together those from industry and government as well as those from 
 academia. In order to interact successfully in an open and heterogeneous 
 environment\, being able to dynamically and adaptively integrate data 
 from other systems on the go is necessary. This may not be a precise 
 process but a matter of finding a good enough understanding to allow 
 interaction to proceed successfully. With the advent of the Web\, there 
 are massive amounts of information available online that can assist in 
 this task\, but this information is often chaotically organised\, stored 
 in a wide variety of data-formats\, and difficult to interpret. The other 
 part of this workshop (SemQuant) aims to unlock a new paradigm in 
 Semantic Web research\, and even in KR research in general\, by adding a 
 quantitative research paradigm to the traditionally predominant 
 qualitative logic-based paradigm. This is motivated in part by the 
 significant growth in Semantic Web data\, including ontologies and Linked 
 Data\, over recent years. To efficiently manage the vast quantities of 
 knowledge and data on the Semantic Web\, we need theories and tools to 
 address questions like: How can we measure knowledge? How are these 
 measurements different from measurements of information? How can we 
 efficiently store knowledge? How can we efficiently and accurately 
 transform knowledge on noisy channels like the Web? How can we measure 
 the quality of ontologies and other forms of knowledge? How can we 
 determine the quality of approximate methods for inference\, similarity\, 
 soundness\, completeness\, etc.? How can such quantitative formalization 
 help the engineering and realization of the Semantic Web?

DESCRIPTION:abstract: The goal of this workshop is to strengthen the 
 participation of the semantic web community in the recent surge of 
 research on the use of events as a key concept for representing knowledge 
 and organising and structuring media on the web. The workshop invites 
 contributions to three central themes: event detection\, event 
 representation\, and event exploitation. Its goal is to formulate answers 
 to questions in these themes that advance and reflect the current state 
 of understanding. Each submission will be expected to address at least 
 two themes explicitly\, if possible including a system demonstration. 
 This year\, we specifically invite contributions that address both event 
 and conversation semantics in multimedia and social media.

DESCRIPTION:abstract: The quantity of published Linked Data is increasing 
 dramatically. However\, applications that consume Linked Data are not yet 
 widespread. Current approaches lack methods for seamless integration of 
 Linked Data from multiple sources\, dynamic discovery of available data 
 and data sources\, provenance and information quality assessment\, 
 application development environments\, and appropriate end user 
 interfaces. Addressing these issues requires well-founded research\, 
 including the development and investigation of concepts that can be 
 applied in systems which consume Linked Data from the Web. Following the 
 success of the 1st and the 2nd International Workshop on Consuming Linked 
 Data\, we organize the third edition of this workshop in order to provide 
 a platform for discussion and work on these open research problems. The 
 main objective is to provide a venue for scientific discourse  
 including systematic analysis and rigorous evaluation  of concepts\, 
 algorithms and approaches for consuming Linked Data.

DESCRIPTION:abstract: EvoDyn 2012 continues the tradition of EvoDyn 2011 
 and the IWOD workshop series in being the core annual event to discuss 
 advances in the broad area of ontology dynamics\, and to track recent 
 work directly or indirectly related to the problem of evolving knowledge. 
 The workshop focuses on analysis of trends and change in formal 
 descriptions\, but also in associated raw sources of knowledge 
 (scientific publications\, unstructured or semi-structured Web content\, 
 traditional data stores\, e-mail or on-line discussion threads\, etc.). 
 We are especially interested in research targeted on various states of 
 knowledge evolution\, such as (a) conflicts\, (b) consolidation\, (c) 
 discovery\, (d) paradigm shifts\, and (e) breakthroughs. We would like to 
 trigger a comprehensive and coherent approach to studying the process of 
 knowledge evolution by bringing together researchers and practitioners 
 from the following fields: (i) Data mining and knowledge discovery in 
 dynamic resources\; (ii) Ontology dynamics and versioning\; (iii) Trend 
 analysis (in multiple applications\, including internet search\, corpus 
 evaluation\, etc.)\; (iv) Natural Language Processing (evolution of 
 terminology\, language use\, semantics)\; (v) Knowledge Representation 
 (temporal ontologies\, temporal logics\, belief revision\, etc.)\; (vi) 
 Discourse Analysis and Philosophy of Science (the definition and 
 understanding of what particular phases of the knowledge evolution are\, 
 and how can we delimit\, identify or even trigger them).

DESCRIPTION:abstract: The Semantic Web is growing at an enormous pace. 
 However\, the development of semantic web software applications is not 
 yet mainstream. Reasons for that include one (or more) of the following 
 research issues: lack of integrated development environments (IDEs\, such 
 as Visual Studio and Eclipse)\, poor programming language support\, lack 
 of standard testbeds and/or benchmarks\, inadequate training\, and 
 perhaps the need for curricula revision. Properly addressing these issues 
 requires interdisciplinary skills\, and the collaboration between 
 academia and industry. The First Workshop on Programming the Semantic Web 
 invites submissions that explore the gap between todays semantic web 
 challenges\, particularly the ones related to dealing with large amounts 
 of data\, with the lack of adequate tools. We are looking for 
 contributions that discuss\, promote and further advance the programming 
 facet of the semantic web\, including the development of new languages\, 
 extension of existing ones\, and the inclusion of semantic enabled 
 capabilities into existing IDEs.

DESCRIPTION:presenter: Mark A. Musen\nabstract: In the 1990s\, as the 
 World Wide Web became not only world wide but also dense and ubiquitous\, 
 workers in the artificial intelligence community were drawn to the 
 possibility that the Web could provide the foundation for a new kind of 
 AI.  Having survived the AI Winter of the 1980s\, the opportunities that 
 they saw in the largest\, most interconnected computing platform 
 imaginable were obviously compelling.  With the subsequent success of the 
 Semantic Web\, however\, our community seems to have stopped talking 
 about many of the issues that researchers believe led to the AI Winter in 
 the first place: the cognitive challenges in debugging and maintaining 
 complex systems\, the drift in the meanings ascribed to symbols\, the 
 situated nature of knowledge\, the fundamental difficulty of creating 
 robust models.  These challenges are still with us\; we cannot wish them 
 away with appeals to the open-world assumption or to the law of large 
 numbers.  Embracing these challenges will allow us to expand the scope of 
 our science and our practice\, and will help to bring us closer to the 
 ultimate vision of the Semantic Web.

DESCRIPTION:chair: Opher Etzion\,Nenad Stojanovic\,Ljiljana 
 Stojanovic\,Francoise Baude\nabstract: Processing of real-time data 
 streams has become a very important mechanism in many application areas: 
 Smart cities\, Smart grid\, eHealth\, to name but a few. Although 
 semantic technologies have been recognized as one of very important 
 enablers for this type of applications\, there are still several 
 challenges to be resolved in order to apply them in real-world 
 applications. Two most important challenges are: an expressive query 
 language that enables the description of complex situations to be 
 detected (considering real-time and historical data) and an efficient 
 asynchronous retrieval mechanism for the large distributed data streams. 
 Beside elaborating on the importance of these challenges for the 
 real-time aware applications\, in this tutorial we give an overview of 
 existing approaches for the semantic processing of real-time streams and 
 present a novel approach based on the recent development in two emerging 
 research areas\, Complex Event Processing\, that enables an efficient in 
 memory processing of huge real-time data and Cloud Computing\, that 
 supports an elastic storage of enormous data volumes. Two studies will be 
 demonstrated: We will show conceptual and technical details of the 
 public-available Platform PLAY\, that realizes presented approach. We 
 will demonstrate its usage through two applications that combine 
 real-time events coming from Smartphone (geo position\, incoming 
 /outgoing /missing calls)\, Social media (Facebook wall updates and 
 recent tweets) and real-time sensors. The approach for writing semantic 
 adapters for new event sources and semantic patterns to be detected in 
 event streams will be introduced.

DESCRIPTION:abstract: The 2012 Joint Workshop on Scalable and 
 High-Performance Semantic Web Systems (SSWS+HPCSW 2012) focuses on 
 addressing the scalability issue with respect to the development and 
 deployment of systems on the Semantic Web. Typically\, such systems deal 
 with information described in Semantic Web languages like OWL and 
 RDF(S)\, and provide services such as storing\, reasoning\, querying\, 
 analysis\, etc. There are two basic requirements for these systems. 
 First\, they have to satisfy an applications semantic requirements. 
 Second\, they must scale well in order to be of practical use. Given the 
 sheer size and distributed nature of the Semantic Web\, these 
 requirements impose new challenges beyond those addressed by previous 
 systems. This joint workshop consists of two tracks regarding scalability:
  one for knowledge base systems\, and another for high-performance 
 computing. We expect that the issue of scalability is going to challenge 
 the Semantic Web for a long period of time and significant effort is 
 needed in order to tackle the problem. This joint workshop seeks to bring 
 together researchers and practitioners to share their recent ideas and 
 progress towards building scalable systems for the Semantic Web\; 
 participants from related disciplines such as Supercomputing\, and 
 High-Performance Computing\, Artificial Intelligence\, Databases\, 
 Information Integration\, are welcome.

DESCRIPTION:abstract: The vision of the Multilingual Semantic Web 
 workshop series is the creation of a Semantic Web where semantically 
 structured information can be aligned\, integrated and used across 
 languages. The workshops are concerned with research questions on how 
 current Semantic Web infrastructure can and should be extended to support 
 this vision. Ontologies and linked data vocabularies are defined often in 
 one language only (English)\, with a biased semantics and a corresponding 
 world view. An infrastructure should be in place for defining ontologies 
 and vocabularies in multiple languages with a transparent semantics 
 across them. Current Semantic Web representation languages (RDF\, OWL\, 
 SKOS) are limited in regard of the representation of natural language 
 semantics\, leaving much of the semantics hidden in textual web content 
 out of scope for the developing Web of Data. NLP and machine learning for 
 Linked Data can benefit from exploiting linguistic resources such as 
 annotated corpora\, Wordnets etc. if they are themselves formally 
 represented and linked by use of Linked Data principles. In addressing 
 such research questions\, the workshop aims at providing a forum for 
 researchers at the intersection of NLP\, multilingual information 
 access\, Linked Data and the Semantic Web to exchange ideas on realizing 
 the Multilingual Semantic Web.

DESCRIPTION:abstract: Ontology matching is a key interoperability enabler 
 for the Semantic Web\, as well as a useful tactic in some classical data 
 integration tasks dealing with the semantic heterogeneity problem. It 
 takes the ontologies as input and determines as output an alignment\, 
 that is\, a set of correspondences between the semantically related 
 entities of those ontologies. These correspondences can be used for 
 various tasks\, such as ontology merging\, data translation\, query 
 answering or navigation on the web of data. Thus\, matching ontologies 
 enables the knowledge and data expressed in the matched ontologies to 
 interoperate.

DESCRIPTION:chair: Padmashree Ravindra\,Kemafor Anyanwu\nabstract: Cloud 
 computing platforms such as Amazons EC2 and Hadoop have had significant 
 adoption as large scale data processing platforms. Their attraction is 
 the possibility of fault-tolerant execution and elastic scaling up or 
 down of resources based on user requirements with minimal administrative 
 burden to users. The rapid surge in volume of available RDF data has 
 sharpened focus on the issue of large scale processing of RDF\, making 
 RDF query processing in the cloud an important topic. RDF data processing 
 in the cloud requires considerations about appropriate storage models and 
 computing environments and the impact of their underlying assumptions on 
 RDFs schema-last and join-intensive workloads. Some example 
 considerations are the absence of indexes and statistics usually relied 
 on by traditional query optimization techniques and the heavy 
 materialization in runtime execution environments such as Hadoop vs. 
 pipelined execution plans used in traditional data processing systems. 
 This tutorial will cover RDF query processing in the cloud\, particularly 
 MapReduce execution platforms such as Hadoop. It will overview the basics 
 of cloud computing and cloud data storage systems\, optimization issues 
 and the state-of-the-art in RDF query optimization for cloud systems. It 
 will also discuss future directions and open issues in query optimization 
 for MapReduce environments.

DESCRIPTION:abstract: The Workshop on Ontology Patterns is an arena for 
 sharing ideas\, innovations\, and novel research results concerning 
 patterns for semantic technologies. Patterns for ontology engineering is 
 a large part\, but we also welcome reports on other kinds of knowledge 
 and data patterns\, design patterns for Semantic Web applications\, as 
 well as best practices in general. Patterns need to be shared by a 
 community in order to provide a common language\, and to stimulate 
 pattern usage and development - therefore we hope to see you at WOP to 
 discuss your patterns!

DESCRIPTION:abstract: More and more semantic data are published following 
 the Linked Data principles\, that enable to set up links between objects 
 in different data sources\, by connecting information in a single global 
 data space: the Web of Data. Today\, Web of Data includes different types 
 of knowledge represented in a homogeneous form: sedimentary one 
 (encyclopedic\, cultural\, linguistic\, common-sense) and real-time one 
 (news\, data streams\, ...). This data might be useful to interlink 
 diverse information about users\, items\, and their relations and 
 implement reasoning mechanisms that can support and improve the 
 recommendation process.  The challenge is to investigate whether and how 
 this large amount of wide-coverage and linked semantic knowledge can be 
 automatically introduced into systems that perform tasks requiring 
 human-level intelligence. Examples of such tasks include understanding a 
 health problem in order to make a medical decision\, or simply deciding 
 which laptop to buy. Recommender systems support users exactly in those 
 complex tasks.  The primary goal of the workshop is to showcase cutting 
 edge research on the intersection of Semantic Technologies and 
 Recommender Systems\, by taking the best of the two worlds. This 
 combination may provide the Semantic Web community with important 
 real-world scenarios where its potential can be effectively exploited 
 into systems performing complex tasks.

DESCRIPTION:abstract: This workshop will discuss different approach to 
 deal with uncertainty (in a wide sense) in the Semantic Web. Uncertainty 
 is an unavoidable factor in several processes\, such as knowledge 
 interchange and application interoperability\, and Semantic Web data\, 
 which are usually incomplete\, inconsistent\, and inaccurate. This 
 suggests the need to apply different formalisms (probability\,  fuzzy 
 logic\, decision theory\, etc.) to enrich Semantic Web technologies and 
 applications.

DESCRIPTION:abstract: Workshop participants will discuss sketches of 
 their papers with editors and eidtorial board members of the top Semantic 
 Web jorunals as well as other workshop participants. The goal is to help 
 attendees to turn the sketches into successful submissions and avoid 
 common stumbling blocks. People who wish to participate will be asked to 
 submit a paper sketch (see cfp). The accepted sketeches will be read by 
 the editors and the other chosen participants prior the workshop. Prior 
 to the workshop\, participants whose sketches have been accepted to will 
 receive one to three other sketches to read and review. During the 
 workshop\, participants will meet in small groups which includes an 
 editorial board memeber. During this discussion\, participants will 
 receive specific feedback on on the possible issues to address in order 
 to turn the sketch into a possibly successful submission. Selection for 
 the Journal Workshop session is competitive. Papers currently under 
 review or revision are excluded.

DESCRIPTION:abstract: The ISWC 2012 Doctoral Consortium will take place 
 as part of the 11th International Semantic Web Conference in Boston\, US. 
 This forum will provide PhD students an opportunity to share and develop 
 their research ideas in a critical but supportive environment\, get 
 feedback from mentors who are senior members of the Semantic Web research 
 community\, explore issues related to academic and research careers\, and 
 build relationships with other Semantic Web PhD students from around the 
 world. The Consortium aims to broaden the perspectives and improve the 
 research and communication skills of these students as a way to 
 contribute both to the individuals as well as to the broader research 
 community.

DESCRIPTION:abstract: The wide availability of technologies such as GPS\, 
 map services and social networks has resulted in the proliferation of 
 geospatial data on the Web. In addition to material produced by 
 professionals (e.g.\, maps)\, the public has also been encouraged to make 
 geospatial content\, including their geographical location and a record 
 of their outdoor activities\, available online. The volume of such user- 
 generated geospatial content is constantly growing. Similarly\, the 
 amount of data extracted from the Web and published as Linked Open Data 
 is increasing. Linked Open Data include many data sets with geospatial 
 properties such as coordinates\, feature class or topological relations. 
 The geo-referencing of Web resources and users has given rise to various 
 services and applications that exploit it. With the location of users 
 being made available widely\, new issues such as those pertaining to 
 security and privacy arise. Likewise\, emergency response\, context 
 sensitive user applications\, and complex GIS tasks all lend themselves 
 toward solutions that combine both the Geospatial Web and the Semantic 
 Web. The workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners from 
 various disciplines\, as well as interested parties from industry and 
 government\, to advance the frontiers of this exciting research area.
