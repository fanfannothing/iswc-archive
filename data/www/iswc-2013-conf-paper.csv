The tool is based on Boxer which implements a DRT-compliant deep parser.
The logical output of Boxer is enriched with semantic data from VerbNet (or FrameNet) frames and transformed into RDF/OWL by means of a mapping model

Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a formal transformation of  $\mathcal{ELI}$ (an extension of $\mathcal{EL}$ with \textit{inverse roles}) ontologies into an FCA framework, i.e.  $K_\mathrm{\mathcal{ELI}}$, and we provide a formal characterization of this transformation.
Then we show that SPARQL query answering over  $\mathcal{ELI}$ ontologies can be reduced to lattice query answering over  $K_\mathrm{\mathcal{ELI}}$ concept lattices.

At over 31 billion triples in 2011, querying this globally distributed data space poses several scalability challenges. One critical aspect when processing distributed SPARQL queries is given by the number and type of distributed joins needed. Traditionally, query optimizers alleviate this issue by attempting to find an optimal query plan assuming a given and fixed data distribution. Discarding this fixed data partitioning assumption, offers the opportunity to create a data distribution that minimizes the number of distributed joins. Recent research focused on data- and query-driven partitioning strategies for both RDF and relational data. In this paper we propose a novel and naive workload-driven approach to data partitioning and investigate the impact of various critical factors on the number of resulting distributed joins. In a preliminary experiment we empirically compare our method to traditional partitioning strategies using a DBpedia query log of 400’000 queries and observe that it can produce up to 50% less distributed joins than an expert (manual) partitioning scheme, 45% less than partitioning based on hashing by subject and up to 83% less distributed joins than just random assignment.",Poster/Demo Paper,,0,,0,Cosmin Basca;Abraham Bernstein,2,,0

Towards this objective, we propose a novel approach of indexing concepts using ontology axioms in an inverted file structure and ranking them using a dynamic ranking algorithm.

Then in the contextual tag cloud, the font size of each tag depends on the number of instances that are associated with that tag and all tags in the context. Each contextual tag cloud serves as a summary of the distribution of relevant data, and by changing the context, the user can quickly gain an understanding of patterns in the data. Furthermore, the user can choose to include RDFS taxonomic and/or domain/range entailment in the calculations of tag sizes, thereby understanding the impact of semantics on the data.

To ensure scalability most distributed systems partition the data and distribute the workload among multiple machines. This approach does, however, raise the question how the data and the workload should be partitioned and distributed.
A uniform scheduling strategy---a uniform distribution of computation load among available machines---typically used by stream processing systems, disregards network-load as one of the major bottlenecks for throughput resulting in an immense load in terms of inter-machine communication.
 We propose a graph-partitioning based approach for workload scheduling within stream processing systems.We implemented a distributed triple-stream processing engine on top of the Storm realtime computation framework and evaluate its communication behavior using two real-world datasets. We show that the application of graph partitioning algorithms can decrease inter-machine communication substantially (by 40% to 99%) whilst maintaining an even workload distribution, even using very limited data statistics. We also find that processing RDF data as single triples at a time rather than graph fragments (containing multiple triples), may decrease throughput indicating the usefulness of semantics.",Poster/Demo Paper,,0,,0,Thomas Scharrenbach;Lorenz Fischer;Abraham Bernstein,3,,0

The telecomoperators own and manage billions of mobile network events (like the Call DetailedRecords - CDR) per day: the interpretation of such a big stream of dataneeds a deep understanding of the context where the events have occurred. Theexploitation of available background knowledge is a key element in this scenario.In this paper we introduce a novel method for the semantic interpretation of humanbehavior in mobility based on the merge of the mobile network data streamand the geo-referred available background knowledge. We modeled the humanbehavior making use of the geo and time-referenced knowledge available on theweb (e.g., geo-tagged resources, info on weather forecast, social events, etc.)matching it with the mobile network coverage map. The model is intended tocharacterize the contexts where the mobile network events occur in order to helpin interpreting the behavioral traits that generated by them. This will allow us toachieve a set of predictive tasks such as the prediction of human activities in certain contextual conditions (e.g., when an accident occurs on highway before theworking time starts, etc.), or the characterization of exceptional events detectedfrom anomalies in mobile network data.We created an ontological and stochastic high-level representation behavioralmodel (HRBModel) that maps the human activities to the different contexts.Given the mobile phone network and the geo-tagged resource Openstreetmap,the model is used to rank the activities associated to a particular network event(e.g. a sudden call amount peak) according to their probability. We also describethe design of an experimental evaluation and the preliminary evaluation resultsto measure the performance of the model and to improve the activity predictiontask.",Poster/Demo Paper,,0,,0,Zolzaya Dashdorj;Luciano Serafini,2,,0

Modern reasoners have a large array of optimization, tuned calculi, and implementation tricks that allow them to perform very well in a variety of application scenarios, even though the complexity results ensure that they will perform poorly for some inputs. For users, the key question is how often they will encounter those pathological inputs in practice, that is, how robust are reasoners. We attempt to determine this question for classification of existing ontologies as they are found on the Web. It is a fairly common user task to examine ontologies published on the Web as part of their development process. Thus, the robustness of reasoners in this scenario is both directly interesting and provides some hints toward answering the broader question. From our experiments, we show that the current crop of OWL reasoners, in collaboration, is very robust against the Web.",Poster/Demo Paper,,0,,0,Rafael S.

The index structure is represented as a graph where each index vertex corresponds to a triple pattern. Partially matched queries are routed in parallel along different paths of this index structure.

We investigate whether it is feasible to use ontologies and ontology-based data access to automate one of common clinical tasks that are constantly faced by general practitioners but labor intensive and error prone in term of relevant information retrieved from electronic health records. The focus of our study is on improving diabetes patient selection for clinical trials or medical research. The biggest impediment to automating such clinical tasks is the essential requirement of bridging the semantic gaps between existing patient data from electronic health records, such as reasons for visit, chronic conditions and diagnoses from practice notes, pathology tests and prescriptions stored in general practice information systems, and the ways which researchers or general practitioners interpret those records. Our current comprehension is that automation of identifying diabetes patients for clinical or research purposes can be specified systematically as a solution supported by semantic retrieval. We detail the challenges to build a realistic case study, which consists of solving issues related to conceptualization of data and domain context, integration of different datasets, ontology creation based on SNOMED CT-AU® standard, mapping between existing data and ontology, and dilemma of data fitness for research use.
