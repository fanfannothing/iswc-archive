<h3>Abstract</h3>
<span id=abstract>
<ul><li>Spreadsheet tools are often used in business and private scenarios in order to collect and store data, and to explore and analyze these data by executing functions and aggregations. They allow users to incrementally compose calculations by filling cells with formulas that are evaluated against data in the sheet, whereas expressions can be nested via cell references. In this paper we present Tripcel, a tool that applies the spreadsheet concept to RDF. It allows users to formulate expressions over the contents of an RDF graph, to arrange these expressions in a grid, and to interactively inspect their evaluation results. Thus it can be used to perform analysis tasks over large data sets within an understandable and familiar interface.
