<h3>Abstract</h3>
<span id=abstract>
<ul><li>Research profiling is a widely-adopted method to monitor research development and rank research performance. This paper describes a novel infrastructure to generate semantic-powered research profiling for research fields, organizations and individuals. It crawls related websites and news feeds, extracts research terms, research objects and relations from them and uses the proposed Research Ontology to model them into RDF triples to facilitate semantic queries and semantic mining on burst detection, hot topic detection, dynamics of research, and relation mining. The authors implement a research profiling experiment in Artificial Intelligence area to show the effectiveness of the research profiling based on semantic mining.
