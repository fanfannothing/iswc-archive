<h3>Abstract</h3>
<span id=abstract>
<ul><li>Application integration can be carried out on three different levels: the data source level, the business logic level, and the user interface level. With ontologies-based integration on the data source level dating back to the 1990s and semantic web services for integrating on the business logic level coming of age, it is time for the next logical step: employing ontologies for integration on the user interface level. Such an approach will improve both the development times and the usability of integrated applications. In this poster, we present an approach employing ontologies for integrating applications on the user interface level.
