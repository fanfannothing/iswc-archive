<h3>Abstract</h3>
<span id=abstract>
<ul><li>In many data-centric applications, it is desirable to use OWL as an
expressive schema language with which one expresses constraints that
must be satisfied by instance data.  However, specific aspects of
OWL's standard semantics---i.e., the Open World Assumption (OWA) and
the absence of Unique Name Assumption (UNA)---make it difficult to use
OWL in this way. In this paper, we present an Integrity Constraint (IC) semantics for OWL axioms, show that IC validation can be reduced to query answering, and present our preliminary results with a prototype implementation using Pellet.
