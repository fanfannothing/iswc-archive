<h3>Abstract</h3>
<span id=abstract>
<ul><li>In this demo paper we describe SPoX, a tool that allows to define the 
behaviour of Skype based on reactive Semantic Web policies. SPoX (Skype Policy 
Extension) enables users to define policies stating, for example, who is 
allowed to call and whose chat messages show up. Moreover, SPoX reacts to 
arbitrary events in Skype's Social Network as well, such as on-line status 
changes of users or the birthday of a friend. The decisions about how SPoX 
reacts are defined by means of Semantic Web policies that do not only consider 
the context of the user (such as time or on-line status) but include Social 
Semantic Web data into the policy reasoning process. By this means, users can 
state that, for instance, only people defined as friends in their FOAF profile, 
only friends on Twitter, or even only people they wrote a paper with are 
allowed to call. Further, SPoX exploits Semantic Web techniques for advanced 
negotiations by means of exchanging policies over the Skype application 
channel. This procedure allows two clients to negotiate trust based on their 
SPoX policies before a connection - for example a Skype call - is established.
