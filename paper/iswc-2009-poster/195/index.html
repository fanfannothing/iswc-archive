<h3>Abstract</h3>
<span id=abstract>
<ul><li>Hierarchical classifications are available for many domains of interest. They often provide a large amount of category definitions and some sort of hierarchies. Thanks to their size and popularity, they are a promising ground for publishing and organizing data on the Semantic Web. 

<p>Unfortunately, classifications can mostly not be directly used as ontologies in OWL, because they are not (or at least: very bad) ontologies. In particular, the labels in categories often lack a context-neutral notion of what it means to be an instance of that category, and the meaning of the hierarchical relations is often not a strict subClassOf. 

<p>SKOS2OWL is an online tool that allows deriving consistent RDF-S or OWL ontologies from most hierarchical classifications available in the W3C SKOS exchange format. SKOS2OWL helps the user narrow down the intended meaning of the available categories to classes and guides the user through several modeling choices. In particular, SKOS2OWL can draw a representative random sample of relevant conceptual elements in the SKOS file and asks the user to make statements about their meaning. This can be used to make reliable modeling decisions without looking at every single element, which would be unfeasible for large classifications.
