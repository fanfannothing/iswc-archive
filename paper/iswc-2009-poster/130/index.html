<h3>Abstract</h3>
<span id=abstract>
<ul><li>We propose a new utility for Semantic Web called as Analogy Engine. Analogy engine employs an example based search approach for retrieving the most similar URIs for the given URI by comparing number of shared links. The Analogy engine is based on Analogy Space, which uses Singular Value Decomposition on matrix representation of a Semantic Network. However Analogy Space faces difficulty with networks having more than a few thousand nodes. We present our preliminary work on scaling Analogy Space by dividing the network into multiple communities, and creating separate Analogy Space for each community. We show that this procedure results in significant improvements and can be used for a large scale network such as the Semantic Web.
