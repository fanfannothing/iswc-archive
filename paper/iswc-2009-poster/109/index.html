<h3>Abstract</h3>
<span id=abstract>
<ul><li>LMI is a not-for-profit research organization committed to helping government leaders and managers reach decisions that make a difference on issues of national importance.

<p>Climate change will be one of the defining issues of this century. It has moved from the province of specialists in environmental issues to one of concern for all government leaders. The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the U.S. Global Change Research Program, and individual U.S. agencies have produced important studies of climate change. However, the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) alone is over 2600 pages. Within these pages, LMI identified 2693 findings that include specific defined levels of uncertainty.

<p>The findings from the IPCC have been so thoroughly demonstrated by the scientific method that it would be a failure of responsibility to ignore them. They form the basis for the LMI Climate Change Knowledge Engine (LMI-CliCKE™) and A Federal Leader’s Guide to Climate Change – a LMI published book written to assist leaders of federal agencies in addressing the challenges associated with climate change.

<p>Thorough analysis of the 2693 findings led LMI to develop a semantically driven, wiki-based web site that allows users to explore, analyze, evaluate, and compare scientific findings related to climate change. The LMI Climate Change Knowledge Engine (LMI-CliCKE™) gives full text and categorical details of the findings and relationships among them. As an initial prototype the LMI climate team has selected and categorized all findings from the AR4.
