<h3>Abstract</h3>
<span id=abstract>
<ul><li>Mobile applications are of increasing interest for research and industry. The widespread use and improved capabilities of portable devices enable the deployment of sophisticated and powerful applications that provide the user with services at any time and location. When such applications are built on top of Linked Data, permanent network connectivity is required, which is often not available or expensive to establish. Hence we propose a framework that uses RDF-based context descriptions to selectively and proactively replicate data to mobile devices. These replicas can be used when no network connection can be established, thus making mobile applications and users more autonomous and stable.
