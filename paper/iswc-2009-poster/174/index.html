<h3>Abstract</h3>
<span id=abstract>
<ul><li>The Lexical Grid (LexGrid) project is an on-going community-driven initiative coordinated by the Mayo Clinic Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics. It provides a common terminology model to represent multiple vocabulary and ontology sources as well as a scalable and robust API for accessing such information. While successfully used and adopted in the biomedical and clinical community, LexGrid model now needs to be aligned with emerging Semantic Web standards and specifications. This paper introduces the LexRDF model, which maps the LexGrid model elements to corresponding constructs in W3C speci¯cations such as RDF, OWL, and SKOS. With LexRDF, the terminological information represent in LexGrid can be translated to RDF triples, and therefore allowing LexGrid to leverage standard tools and technologies such as SPARQL and RDF triple stores.
