<h3>Abstract</h3>
<span id=abstract>
<ul><li>As the Linked Data initiatives and Web of Data become more widespread, sites that process and re-present the published data are growing in size and number. One challenge is to ensure that such sites do not themselves fall into the trap of failing to publish their new knowledge in a readily available manner. Not only should the work of such sites be re-published for Linked Data users, but it should also be accessible to site builders who have not yet embraced the Semantic Web. This paper presents the work that has been done with the RKBExplorer system to support this task, and describes examples of how it is used.
