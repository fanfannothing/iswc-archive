<h3>Abstract</h3>
<span id=abstract>
<ul><li>The Semantic Web was designed to unambiguously define and use ontologies to encode data and knowledge on the Web. Many people find it difficult, however, to write complex RDF statements and queries because it requires familiarity with the appropriate ontologies and the terms they define. We describe a framework that eases the experiences in authoring and querying RDF data, in
which we focus on automatically finding a set of appropriate Semantic Web ontology terms from a set of words used as the labels of nodes and edges in an incoming semantic graph.
