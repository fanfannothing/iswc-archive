<h3>Abstract</h3>
<span id=abstract>
<ul><li>Ontologies play a central role for the formal representation of
knowledge on the Semantic Web. A major challenge in
collaborative ontology construction is to handle inconsistencies
caused by changes to the ontology. In this paper, we present our CoDR
system which helps to diagnose and repair collaboratively constructed
ontologies. CoDR integrates RaDON, an ontology diagnosis and repair tool,
and Cicero, which provides discussion functionality for the ontology developers.
CoDR is realized as a plugin for the NeOn Toolkit. It helps to use discussions
held in Cicero as context information during repairing an ontology with RaDON.
But it is also possible to use the diagnoses from RaDON during the discussions
in Cicero.
