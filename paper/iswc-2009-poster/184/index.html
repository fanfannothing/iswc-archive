<h3>Abstract</h3>
<span id=abstract>
<ul><li>Semantic graphs can be seen as a way of representing and visualizing textual information in more structured, RDF-like graphs. The reader thus obtains an overview of the content, without having to read through the text. In building a compact semantic graph, an important step is grouping similar concepts under the same label and connecting them to external repositories. This is achieved through disambiguating word senses, in our case by assigning the sense to a concept given its context. The paper presents an unsupervised, knowledge based word sense disambiguating algorithm for linking semantic graph nodes to the WordNet vocabulary. The algorithm is integrated in the semantic graph generation pipeline, improving the semantic graph readability and conciseness. Experimental evaluation of the proposed disambiguation algorithm shows that it gives good results.
