<h3>Abstract</h3>
<span id=abstract>
<ul><li>Like web services, semantically-operated services can be assembled to construct a new composite service. For this, we designed the semantic broker that searches semantic services matched with given conditions, assembles them to dynamically generate pipelines of semantic services, and execute the pipelines. By executing the resulting pipelines, the user can select one which he/she really intended. In this way, our system can help the user who wants to design new semantically-operated services by mashing up the existing semantically-operated services.
