<h3>Abstract</h3>
<span id=abstract>
<ul><li>The advent of technologies in information retrieval driven by users’
requests calls for an effort to conceive and develop semantic-based
applications. In recent years the semantic web gave place for a
new generation of search query engines that rely on the semantic
of the documents expressed by metadata. In this paper we present
a knowledge-based approach to visualizing and navigating through
conference video-recordings. This approach is based on a conference
ontology that models the information conveyed within a conference
life cycle.
