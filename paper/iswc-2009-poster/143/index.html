<h3>Abstract</h3>
<span id=abstract>
<ul><li>Leadsto is a prototypical Semantic Portal for collaboratively describing statements of the form “x leads to y” (e.g. “accident leads to traffic jam”). Existing elements of statements (precedents, antecedents) can be linked with each other, and completely new elements can be created. Individual statements can be created and the set of stored statements further extended and developed collaboratively on the Web by humans; in addition, automated approaches for extracting further statements from any web page are employed. The constantly growing net-like structure can be searched and navigated. The major benefit of the system is to automatically discover and make available causal chains of the form “x leads to y “,” y leads to z “, etc. (as well as the reverse direction). In this way, not yet known facts as well as their provenance can be collaboratively discovered by the wisdom of a crowd.
