<h3>Abstract</h3>
<span id=abstract>
<ul><li>Large scale semantic web applications require efficient and robust description logic (DL) reasoning services. In this paper, we present a soundness preserving tractable approximative reasoning approach for TBox reasoning in R, a fragment of OWL2-DL supporting ALC GCIs and role chains with 2ExpTime-hard complexity. We first rewrite the ontologies into EL+ with an additional complement table maintaining the complementary relations between named concepts, and then classify the approximation. Preliminary evaluation shows that our approach can classify existing benchmarks in large scale efficiently with a high recall.
