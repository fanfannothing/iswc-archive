<h3>Abstract</h3>
<span id=abstract>
<ul><li>All About That (AAT) is a URI Profiling tool which allows users to monitor and preserve Linked Data in which they are interested.  Its design is based upon the principle of adapting ideas from hypermedia link integrity in order to apply them to the Semantic Web.  As the Linked Data Web expands it will become increasingly important to maintain links such that the data remains useful and therefore this tool is presented as a step towards providing this maintenance capability.
