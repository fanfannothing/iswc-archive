<h3>Abstract</h3>
<span id=abstract>
<ul><li>In this demo we will present XLWrap-Server, which is a wrapper for collections of spreadsheets providing a SPARQL and Linked Data interface similar to D2R-Server. It is based on XLWrap, a novel approach for generating RDF graphs of arbitrary complexity from spreadsheets with different layouts. To our best knowledge, XLWrap is the first spreadsheet wrapper, supporting cross tables and tables where data is not aligned in rows. It features a full expression algebra based on the syntax of OpenOffice Calc which can be easily extended by users and it supports Microsoft Excel, Open Document, and large CSV spreadsheets. XLWrap-Server can be used to integrate information from a collection of spreadsheets. We will show several use-cases and mapping design patterns in our demonstration.
